<h1>THE MOTOR GIRLS<br />ON THE COAST</h1>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_1'></a>1</span><a id='link_1'></a>CHAPTER I<br /><span class='h2fs'>A FLASH OF FIRE</span></h2>

<p>Filled was the room with boys and girls&#8211;yes,
literally filled; for they moved about so from
chair to chair, from divan to sofa, from one side
of the apartment to the other, now and then changing
corners after the manner of the old-fashioned
game of &#8220;puss,&#8221; that what they lacked in numbers
they more than made up in activity. It was
a veritable moving picture of healthful, happy
young persons. And the talk&#8213;!</p>

<p>Questions and answers flew back and forth like
tennis balls in a set of doubles. Repartee mingled
with delicate sarcasm, and new, and almost
indefinable shades of meaning were given to old
and trite expressions.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can depend upon it, Sis!&#8221; drawled Jack
Kimball as he stretched out his foot to see how
far he could reach on the Persian rug without
falling off his chair; &#8220;you can depend upon it
that Belle will shy at the last moment. She&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2'></a>2</span>
afraid of water, the plain, common or garden
variety of water. And when it comes to ripples,
to say nothing of waves, she&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cora, can&#8217;t you make him behave?&#8221; demanded
the plump Belle in question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Belle&#8217;s too&#8211;er&#8211;too&#8211;tired to get up and do
it herself,&#8221; scoffed Ed Foster. &#8220;May I oblige
you, Belle, and tweak his nose for him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come and try it!&#8221; challenged Jack.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let Walter do it,&#8221; advised Bess, who, the
very opposite type of her sister Belle, tall and
willowy&#8211;Ã¦sthetic in a word&#8211;walked to another
divan over which she proceeded to &#8220;drape herself,&#8221;
as Cora expressed it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, let&#8217;s hear what Jack has to say,&#8221; proposed
Walter Pennington, bringing his head of
crisp brown hair a little closer to the chestnut one
of Bess. &#8220;He has made a statement, and it is
now&#8211;will you permit me to say it&#8211;it is now
strictly up to him to prove it. Say on, rash
youth, and let us hear why it is that Belle will shy
at the water.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a riddle, perhaps,&#8221; suggested Eline Carleton,
a visitor from Chicago. &#8220;I love to guess
riddles! Say it again, Jack, do!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why is a raindrop&#8213;&#8221; began Norton Randolf,
a newcomer in Chelton. &#8220;The answer
is&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That you can bring water to a horse, even if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3'></a>3</span>
you can&#8217;t make him stand still without hitching,&#8221;
interrupted Walter. &#8220;Go on, Jack!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see much use in going on, if you fellows&#8211;and
I beg your collective pardons&#8211;the
ladies also&#8211;are to interrupt me all the while.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so&#8211;let&#8217;s play the game fair,&#8221; suggested
Eline. &#8220;Is it a riddle, Jack? Belle is
afraid of the water because&#8211;let me see&#8211;because
it can&#8217;t spoil her complexion no matter
whether it&#8217;s salt or fresh&#8211;is that it?&#8221; and she
glanced over at the slightly pouting Belle, whose
rosy complexion was often the envy of less happily
endowed girls.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not afraid of the water!&#8221; declared Belle.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why he says so, anyhow. It&#8211;it isn&#8217;t&#8211;kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgive me, Belle!&#8221; and Jack &#8220;slumped&#8221;
from his chair to his knees before the offended
one. &#8220;I do beg your pardon, but you know that
ever since we proposed this auto trip to Sandy
Point Cove you&#8217;ve hung back on some pretext
or other. You&#8217;ve even tried to get us to consent
to a land trip. But, in the language of the immortal
Mr. Shakespeare, there is nothing doing.
We are going to the coast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I&#8217;m coming, too,&#8221; said Belle.
&#8220;Stop it, Jack!&#8221; she commanded, drawing her
plump hand away from his brown palm. &#8220;Behave
yourself! Only,&#8221; she went on, as the others
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4'></a>4</span>
ceased laughing, &#8220;only sometimes the ocean seems
so&#8211;so&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oceany,&#8221; supplied Walter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now Jack&#8211;and you other boys also,&#8221; said
Cora in firm tones, &#8220;really it isn&#8217;t fair. Belle is
nervous about water, just as the rest of us are
about some other particular bugbear, but she is
also reasonable, and she has even promised to
learn to swim.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cora brushed from the mahogany centre table
a few morsels of withered lilac petals, for, in
spite of the most careful dusting and setting to
rights of the room, those blooms had a persistent
way of dropping off.</p>

<p>&#8220;Belle swim!&#8221; cried Jack, rising to his feet,
since his advances had been repulsed, &#8220;why she
would have to be done up in a barrel of life preservers,
and then she&#8217;d insist on being anchored
to shore by a ship&#8217;s cable. Belle swim!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed!&#8221; retorted his sister, &#8220;you&#8217;ll soon
find that the more nervous a girl is, the more
persistent she is to learn to swim. She realizes
the necessity of not losing her head in the water.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If she lost her head she wouldn&#8217;t swim very
far,&#8221; put in Ed with gentle sarcasm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put him out!&#8221; ordered Walter. &#8220;But say,
when are we going to get down to the horrible
details, and make some definite plans? This sort
of a tea party suits me all right&#8211;don&#8217;t mistake
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5'></a>5</span>
me,&#8221; he hastened to add, with a glance at Cora,
&#8220;but if we are going, let&#8217;s&#8211;go!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I say,&#8221; came from Belle. &#8220;You
won&#8217;t find me holding back,&#8221; and she crossed the
room to look out of the parlor window across
the Kimball lawn.</p>

<p>&#8220;My! That&#8217;s a stunning dress!&#8221; exclaimed
Jack. &#8220;Fish-line color, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s trying to make amends. Don&#8217;t you believe
him,&#8221; echoed Walter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fish-line color!&#8221; mocked Cora. &#8220;Oh, Jack,
you are hopeless! That&#8217;s the newest shade of
pearl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I almost hit it,&#8221; defended Jack.
&#8220;Pearls are related to fishes, and fish lines
are&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, get a map!&#8221; groaned Ed. &#8220;Do you always
have to make diagrams of your jokes that
way, old man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go outside,&#8221; proposed Cora. &#8220;I&#8217;m
sure it&#8217;s getting stuffy in here&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I like that!&#8221; cried Belle. &#8220;After she
asked us to come, she calls us stuffy! Cora Kimball!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I didn&#8217;t mean it that way at all,&#8221; protested
the young hostess. &#8220;But it is close and
sultry. I shouldn&#8217;t wonder but what we&#8217;d have
a thunder-shower.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say that!&#8221; pleaded Jack, in what Walter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6'></a>6</span>
termed his theatrical voice. &#8220;A shower
means water, and Belle and water&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop it!&#8221; commanded the pestered one. &#8220;Do
come out,&#8221; and she linked her arm in that of
Cora. &#8220;Maybe we can talk sense if we get in
the open.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young people drifted from the room, out
on the broad porch and thence down under the
cedars that lined the path. It was late afternoon,
and though the sky was clouding over, there shot
through the masses now and then a shaft of sun
that fell on the walk between the tree branches,
bringing into relief the figures that &#8220;crunched&#8221;
their way along the gravel, talking rapidly the
while.</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks like a rare old reunion,&#8221; spoke Jack.
&#8220;I guess we&#8217;ll do something worth while after
all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t distress yourself too much, old man,&#8221;
warned Ed. &#8220;You might get a sun-stroke, you
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the time you beat him to it,&#8221; chuckled
Walter. &#8220;Do they do this sort of thing out
your way?&#8221; and he addressed pretty Eline.</p>

<p>She blushed a charming pink under her coat of
tan&#8211;a real biscuit brown, it had been voted by
her admirers. She reminded them of a little red
squirrel, for she had rather that same timid appearance,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7'></a>7</span>
and she nearly always dressed in tan
or brown, to match her complexion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sometimes,&#8221; she murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;Chicago&#8213;&#8221; began Jack in rather judicial
tones.</p>

<p>&#8220;You let Chicago alone!&#8221; advised Walter.
&#8220;I&#8217;m looking after Eline. I won&#8217;t let them hurt
you,&#8221; and he moved closer to her. She seemed
to shrink, whereat the others laughed.</p>

<p>They walked about for a little while, strolling
out to the Kimball garage&#8211;a rebuilt stable,
where three fine machines now stood, two of
them having brought the visitors. Then when
they had acquired the necessary breath of air,
they went back into the house.</p>

<p>Eline matched herself up to a Chippendale
chair, while Belle, always fond of plenty of room,
found it on a divan. Bess had secured one of
those Roman chairs curved up at both ends, seemingly
intended to prevent anyone from sitting anywhere
but in the exact center. She assumed a
graceful pose&#8211;everything Bess did had that attribute.</p>

<p>&#8220;My! it is certainly getting warmer!&#8221; complained
Walter. &#8220;Maybe we should have stayed
out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can talk better in here,&#8221; was Cora&#8217;s opinion.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8'></a>8</span>
&#8220;We&#8217;ll need all the breeze that we can get
on high gear if this keeps up,&#8221; said Ed, with a
sigh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but the dust!&#8221; exclaimed Bess. &#8220;I
know I&#8217;ll simply choke, and&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Chew gum!&#8221; broke in Cora. &#8220;That absorbs
the dust.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t we chew chocolates as well?&#8221; asked
Belle. &#8220;I would rather swallow half the dust
of the roads from here to Sandy Point Cove and
have my throat macadamized, than chew gum.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll allow you to make yours chocolate,&#8221;
conceded Jack, &#8220;though chocolates do not allow
space for&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gab,&#8221; put in Norton Randolf, who seldom
said anything really nice to the girls. Yet he always
managed to interest them with his drawl
and indifference. &#8220;We ought to get out something
that would stop the talk when we get to a
close turn,&#8221; he proceeded. &#8220;I&#8217;m always afraid
some one will release the emergency brake on a
down grade, with a rude remark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s real bright!&#8221; chuckled Ed. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
think!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, please, let&#8217;s get down to business,&#8221; suggested
Cora, crisply. &#8220;The time passes so
quickly, and we have a lot of matters to arrange.
Bess, I put an extra wrench in your tool-box. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span>
remembered your ability in losing those handy
little articles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; drawled Bess. &#8220;But why stop at
a wrench? Why not duplicate all the fixings?
What I don&#8217;t lose Belle does. But then,&#8221; and
she turned mocking, pleading eyes on Jack, &#8220;your
brother is such a dear for fixing us up. I guess
the <i>Flyaway</i> will be there at the finish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it very far where you are going&#8211;to Sandy
Point Cove?&#8221; asked Eline.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; answered Walter, &#8220;it&#8217;s miles and
miles, and then more miles. But we are all going,
little girl, so don&#8217;t worry,&#8221; and he struck
a stiffly-heroic attitude to show his valor.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a good thing you have a livery-stable-sized
garage,&#8221; remarked Ed to Cora. &#8220;It holds
all the cars very nicely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, there isn&#8217;t another in Chelton, except
the public ones, so well arranged,&#8221; added Walter.
&#8220;But we might have waited until morning to
bring the machines here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I thought it was best to have them here
the night before we were to start,&#8221; explained
Cora, who was to assume the leadership of the
prospective trip. &#8220;Some of us might have been
tempted to go out on a little spin this evening,
and an accident might have occurred that would
delay us.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span>&#8220;Did the <i>Petrel</i> get off safely?&#8221; inquired
Ed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Jack. &#8220;It&#8217;s in a regular motor
boat crate that the man said would stand the journey.
I saw it put in the freight car myself, and
well braced. It will be there waiting for us when
we get to the Cove.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope it runs,&#8221; murmured Walter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be a pessimist&#8211;or is it an optimist?
I never can tell which from what,&#8221; spoke Belle.
&#8220;I mean don&#8217;t be one who&#8217;s always looking on
the dark side. Look for the silver lining of the
clouds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, it&#8217;s clouding up all right,&#8221; declared Jack,
as he glanced from the window.</p>

<p>A distant rumble was heard at that moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s thunder!&#8221; exclaimed Belle, &#8220;and we
have no umbrellas.&#8221; She glanced at her sister
and Eline.</p>

<p>&#8220;Better have it rain to-night than to-morrow,
when we want to start,&#8221; said Cora, philosophically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit by me, Belle,&#8221; pleaded Jack. &#8220;I won&#8217;t
let the bad thunder hurt you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll all sit by each other!&#8221; proposed Walter.</p>

<p>This was a signal for a general change of
places, each boy pretending to protect a girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now don&#8217;t let&#8217;s get off the track,&#8221; went on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span>
Cora, when quiet had been restored. &#8220;Are you
all sure that you want to go directly to the Cove,
and don&#8217;t care for a little side trip before reaching
there? Of course it&#8217;s going to be fine at the
shore, and there&#8217;s enough variety so that each one
can find something she or he likes&#8211;rocks, ocean,
sandy beach, a lighthouse&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where they do light housekeeping?&#8221; asked
Ed, softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t,&#8221; Cora begged.</p>

<p>&#8220;Any nice girls down there?&#8221; asked Jack,
making eyes at Eline.</p>

<p>They all started as a particularly loud clap of
thunder followed a vivid flash of lightning, and
the wind rose suddenly, moaning through the
trees.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it will amount to much,&#8221; was
Walter&#8217;s opinion. &#8220;Probably only a wind
storm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I guess I&#8217;d better put down the windows
on the West side,&#8221; remarked Cora. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be back
in a moment&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>As she spoke there came a dash of rain against
the side of the house, and another flash of lightning
was followed by a vibrating peal.</p>

<p>Cora screamed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, what is it?&#8221; demanded Bess, nervously.
Jack clasped her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; cried Cora. &#8220;The garage&#8211;it&#8217;s on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span>
fire. I just saw a flash of flame! Our autos
will be burned!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to get &#8217;em out!&#8221; declared Jack.
&#8220;Come on, fellows!&#8221;</p>

<p>He made a dash for the door. Ed leaped
through the low, open window. Walter followed
Jack. The girls stood uncertain what to do.</p>

<p>&#8220;The lightning struck it!&#8221; gasped Eline.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must help to get out the autos!&#8221; cried
Cora. &#8220;We must help the boys to fight the
fire!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Telephone in an alarm!&#8221; suggested Bess.</p>

<p>&#8220;The autos first! The cars first! We must
get them out!&#8221; Cora cried as she hurried out of
the door, the three other girls trailing after.
&#8220;If we get the cars out the barn can go!&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span><a id='link_2'></a>CHAPTER II<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE STRANGE WOMAN</span></h2>

<p>Only for an instant had Cora Kimball hesitated.
Usually she was even more prompt than
her brother Jack to get into action, but the flash
of fire she had seen in the garage, and the thought
of the valuable cars stored there&#8211;cars in which
they were to make their delightful summer trip&#8211;seemed
to paralyze her for the time being. Then
she was galvanized into life and action.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cora, there comes your car out!&#8221; cried Bess,
as the <i>Whirlwind</i>, the powerful Kimball auto,
was seen to poke its hood from the now blazing
barn. Ed had been the first to reach the structure,
and, quickly switching on the self-starter,
had run the machine out.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess they can get out the others!&#8221; said
Belle, as Walter and Jack dashed inside.</p>

<p>Cora suddenly turned and ran back toward the
house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; asked Eline. &#8220;Oh
dear! The whole place will soon be afire!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m afraid of!&#8221; Cora called
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>
back, over her shoulder. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to get some
extinguishers! Maybe the boys can&#8217;t reach the
one in the barn. It&#8217;s our only chance&#8211;an extinguisher.
Water is the worst thing you can
put on a gasoline fire. Get some pails of sand,
girls!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right&#8211;sand!&#8221; yelled Ed, as he leaped
from Cora&#8217;s car, having taken it a safe distance
down the drive. He went back on the run to
help Jack and Ed. The rain was now pelting
down, but unmindful of it, the girls drew nearer
the burning barn, while Cora sped toward the
house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sand&#8211;pails?&#8221; asked Belle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221; cried Bess. &#8220;There are some pails
over there!&#8221; and she pointed toward a pile of
gardening tools. &#8220;The watering can will be
good, too. Scoop up the sand&#8211;use your hands!&#8221;</p>

<p>She rushed over and picked up one of the pails,
an example followed by her sister and Eline.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, why don&#8217;t those boys come out!&#8221; cried
the latter. &#8220;Maybe they are&#8211;burned!&#8221; she
faltered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps they can&#8217;t get our car started,&#8221; said
Bess. &#8220;Sometimes it just won&#8217;t respond!&#8221;</p>

<p>Quickly they filled the pails with sand, and while
this is being done, and other preparations under
way to fight the fire and save the autos I will take
just a moment to tell my new readers something
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>
about the characters in this story, and how they
figured in previous books of the series.</p>

<p>The first volume, in which Cora Kimball and
her chums were introduced, was entitled &#8220;The
Motor Girls,&#8221; and in that they succeeded in unraveling
a mystery of the road, though it was not
as easy as they at first thought it might be.</p>

<p>Then came &#8220;The Motor Girls on a Tour; Or,
Keeping a Strange Promise,&#8221; and how strange
that promise was, not even Cora realized at the
time. But in spite of difficulties it was kept and a
restoration was made. In the third book, &#8220;The
Motor Girls at Lookout Beach,&#8221; there came the
quest for two runaways.</p>

<p>That girls&#8211;even young girls&#8211;do things on impulse
was made clear to Cora and her friends
when they sought after the rather foolish creatures
who ran such a risk. That only good came of it
was as much due to Cora as to anyone else.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Motor Girls Through New England&#8221;
gave Cora and her companions a chance to see
something of life under strange circumstances.
That one of them would be captured by the gypsies
never for a moment entered their heads. But
it happened, and for a time it looked as though
the results might be serious. But once again Cora
triumphed.</p>

<p>The volume immediately preceding the present
one is entitled &#8220;The Motor Girls on Cedar Lake;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>
Or, The Hermit of Fern Island.&#8221; Who the hermit
was, and the strange secret he kept so long,
and how it was finally solved you will find set
down in that book. Then came the return to
normal life, but with the prospect of more adventures,
on the verge of which we now find Cora
and her friends.</p>

<p>They were ready for the summer vacation,
and had voted to spend it at Sandy Point Cove&#8211;a
resort on the Atlantic coast. It was the evening
before the start, and they had gathered at
Cora&#8217;s house to arrange final details.</p>

<p>They were to motor to the cove, taking their
time, for it was no small distance from Chelton
where our friends lived. The motor boat <i>Petrel</i>
sometimes just called <i>Pet</i> for short, had been
shipped on ahead.</p>

<p>I think I have already mentioned the names
of the young folks. Cora generally came first,
by reason of her personality. She was a splendid
girl, tall and rather dark, and had somewhat of a
commanding air, though she was not at all fond
of her own way, and always willing to give in to
others if it could be made plain that their way
was best. Her mother was a wealthy widow, and
there was Jack, Cora&#8217;s brother, taller than she,
darker perhaps and was he handsomer? Cora
had, some time before, been given a fine large
touring car, and Jack owned a small runabout.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>Walter Pennington was Jack&#8217;s chum, both of
them attending Exmouth College, where, of late,
Ed Foster had taken a post-graduate course. Ed
was very fond of hunting and fishing, and considered
himself quite a sportsman.</p>

<p>The Robinson twins were daughters of Mr.
and Mrs. Perry Robinson, the father being a
wealthy railroad man. He had given the girls
a fine car&#8211;the <i>Flyaway</i> it had been christened&#8211;while
Jack called his the <i>Get There</i>. Sometimes
it did, and sometimes it didn&#8217;t. To go back to
the girls. Belle, or Isabel, as she had been christened,
was plump and rosy, and her sister Bess,
tall, willowy and fair, her rather light hair contrasting
with the brown locks of Belle.</p>

<p>Eline Carleton, from Chicago, a distant cousin
of Cora had been invited to spend the summer
with the Kimballs, and was to go to the Cove.
Norton Randolf was a newcomer in town, said to
be of a wealthy family. He had only lately made
the acquaintance of Jack and his chums, but was
rather well liked.</p>

<p>Chelton, as my previous readers know, was a
most charming semi-country town, nestling in a
bend of the Chelton River, a stream of picturesque
beauty. The location was in New England,
not so far from the New York line that the trip
to the metropolis was a fatiguing one. The
young people had often taken it on pleasure bent.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>
And now, not to keep you any longer from the
story, which I am afraid I interrupted at a rather
critical point, I will merely remark, in passing,
that other characters will be mentioned from time
to time, some of whom have appeared in previous
books.</p>

<p>In the excitement attending the fire, Bess was
puffing on her way to the garage, carrying a pail
of wet sand that she had scooped up from the
driveway. She was followed by the other
girls.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, see the smoke!&#8221; cried Eline. &#8220;That
must be gasoline burning!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is,&#8221; assented Belle. &#8220;Oh, do hurry&#8211;somebody!&#8221;</p>

<p>Cora came running out of the house, carrying
long tin extinguishers, one in each hand, and
one under her right arm. She had just bought a
new lot, and had intended hanging them in the
garage, but had forgotten it.</p>

<p>&#8220;These will be just the thing!&#8221; she cried.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t be frightened! There&#8217;s not much gasoline
in the barn. If we can get out the cars&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Something must be the matter!&#8221; cried Bess.
&#8220;The boys&#8211;they are in there yet&#8211;they may be
overcome!&#8221;</p>

<p>As if to deny this startling suggestion Jack fairly
shot out of the smoke in the <i>Flyaway</i>&#8211;the car
of the twins.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>&#8220;They have left their own car to the last!&#8221;
gasped Belle.</p>

<p>&#8220;They had to!&#8221; Cora panted. &#8220;They could
only take them as they stood, you know. They
were in line. Mine was first, then yours. Oh
Jack! is it very bad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A mean little blaze, Sis! Did you &#8217;phone in
an alarm?&#8221; He wiped his streaming eyes, and,
bringing the car up alongside the <i>Whirlwind</i>,
leaped out to go back to his chums.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here! Take these extinguishers!&#8221; his sister
cried. &#8220;I&#8217;ll get the department in a minute!&#8221;</p>

<p>She tossed the tin tubes to Jack, who, catching
them, ran back toward the barn. It was raining
harder than ever now, but no one seemed to mind
it. The girls were totally oblivious of their smart
gowns, now badly bedraggled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take this sand!&#8221; wailed Belle. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know what to do with it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Grab this sand from the girls!&#8221; yelled Jack
to Ed, Walter and Norton, who, at that moment
came out in Jack&#8217;s car. &#8220;Throw it on the blazing
gasoline! What kept you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your car wouldn&#8217;t crank!&#8221; cried Walter.
&#8220;It&#8217;s all right now, though&#8211;just scorched a little
in the rear!&#8221;</p>

<p>The three lads, Norton clinging to the run-board,
got the car to safety, and then raced back,
grabbed the sand from Belle, Bess and Eline, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span>
followed Jack into the garage, which was now under
a pall of smoke.</p>

<p>The tin tops of the extinguishers were yanked
off, and the chemical powder sprinkled toward the
blaze. Sand was also cast on it, but the fire had
spread more than the boys had thought. The
choking fumes, too, drove the amateur blaze-fighters
back.</p>

<p>Again Cora came running from the house
through the drenching rain.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t get the fire department on the wire!&#8221;
she cried. &#8220;Something is wrong with the telephone!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the storm, I guess,&#8221; answered Jack, coming
to the door of the old barn that had been converted
into a garage. He had to have a breath
of air.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, can we help?&#8221; cried Eline.</p>

<p>&#8220;Better stay out,&#8221; gasped Ed, as he too, came
for a little relief. &#8220;I guess we can keep it from
spreading.&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time several men had run in from the
street.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s your water?&#8221; asked one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t want any!&#8221; cried Jack. &#8220;It&#8217;s gasoline.
Get more sand if you want to&#8211;dry, if you
can find it!&#8221;</p>

<p>He kicked one of the empty pails toward the
men. A flash of lightning blazed over the structure,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>
and the thunder rumbled as the rain came
down harder than ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;This rain&#8217;ll put it out soon enough!&#8221; shouted
one of the men helpers. The boys had gone back
into the barn, leaving the girls outside.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can get some sand in that!&#8221; cried Belle, as
she saw a pan in front of the dog&#8217;s kennel&#8211;it
was used to contain his dinner. The girl began
scooping up in it some of the damp gravel from
the drive.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t! Don&#8217;t!&#8221; cried her sister. &#8220;Drop it.
You mustn&#8217;t hold metal in a thunder storm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m going in!&#8221; exclaimed Eline. &#8220;I
can&#8217;t bear to be in the open when it lightens.&#8221;</p>

<p>She darted toward the garage. Instinctively
the others followed. There seemed to be less
smoke coming out now, and no blaze could be
seen.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess they can stop it,&#8221; murmured Cora.
&#8220;Oh, I do hope they can!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go in and help!&#8221; cried Bess. &#8220;They
may need us!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bravely the motor girls entered the garage. A
shift in the wind had blown the smoke away from
the door. They could see the boys and men fighting
the flames that were in a far corner of the
main room.</p>

<p>Belle suddenly ran forward and dashed on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>
blaze the pan of sand that she had not relinquished.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bravo!&#8221; cried Jack. &#8220;You&#8217;re a heroess!&#8221;</p>

<p>He held his hand to his smarting eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me take that extinguisher!&#8221; begged Belle,
plucking a half-emptied one from him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s one for me!&#8221; exclaimed Bess, picking
it up off the floor. It had not been opened. She
knocked off the top and, doing as the others did,
she sent the powder in a sweeping motion toward
the flames. Some of the men ran out for more
sand. The blaze was being well fought now.
There was really no need for the fire department.</p>

<p>Above the place where the autos were stored
were rooms formerly occupied by the coachman
and his family, before Mrs. Kimball disposed of
her horses. The stairs to these rooms were boxed
in, a door leading directly to the path that went
to the driveway.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can go up there and get another extinguisher!&#8221;
cried Cora, indicating the stairway.
&#8220;I know there&#8217;s one there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No need to!&#8221; exclaimed Ed, who again had
to get a breath of fresh air. But Cora was already
in the enclosed stairway.</p>

<p>The next moment she shrieked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, what is it? Oh dear! Who is it? Come
quick&#8211;someone!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>
Everyone was startled&#8211;even the danger of the
now almost extinguished fire spreading again could
not detract from the import of danger they recognized
in Cora&#8217;s voice.</p>

<p>Some one seemed to answer her from the stairway.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t! Please don&#8217;t! I did not do it! Let
me go! Please do!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, Cora?&#8221; called Jack, preparing to
go to her.</p>

<p>His sister had found a woman in the hallway&#8211;a
strange woman who seemed much excited.
Her pleading tones as she confronted Cora
touched the girl&#8217;s heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let them know I am here&#8211;not yet!&#8221;
begged the stranger. &#8220;I can explain&#8211;everything.
Oh, so much depends on this! Please do
as I say!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right!&#8221; said Cora, making a sudden resolve.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll let you explain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But keep the others back&#8211;they are coming!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll send them back.&#8221; Cora took a few steps
toward the door. She could hear some one running
across the garage floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right!&#8221; cried Cora. &#8220;Go back and
fight the fire, boys. I&#8217;ll be there in a minute. I
want to get that other extinguisher to make certain.
But I thought a rat&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>She knew that would be explanation enough for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>
her cries, and from where they were the boys,
girls, and men now in the garage could not see
her or the strange woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;A rat!&#8221; cried Jack, with a laugh, as he heard
his sister&#8217;s word. &#8220;The idea of being frightened
at a rat in a time of fire!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess the rodents will make short tracks,&#8221;
was Ed&#8217;s opinion. &#8220;Come on, we&#8217;ve got to give
it a little more, Jack!&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys went back to the fire, Bess, Belle
and Eline, who had taken shelter in the garage,
watching them. It was pouring too hard to stand
outside, and, now that the smoke had mostly disappeared,
there was not much discomfort. The
danger, too, was practically over, as a can of
gasoline that had not burned had been set outside.
There had been really more smoke than fire from
the first.</p>

<p>Cora went back to the strange woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;You need not be afraid,&#8221; spoke the girl, in a
tone that gave encouragement. &#8220;We will not
blame you too much&#8211;until we have heard your
story. But of course I must know who you
are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8211;yes,&#8221; answered the woman. She sank
down on the stairs. The place was free of smoke,
and some distance from the blaze. Suddenly the
stranger arose, and clutching Cora&#8217;s arm in a
grip that hurt, and that showed the nervous tension
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>
under which she was laboring, she whispered:</p>

<p>&#8220;I know I can trust you&#8211;I can tell by your
face. But the&#8211;others!&#8221; she gasped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave it to me,&#8221; answered Cora. &#8220;I may
be able to think of a way to help you. Go over
into the kitchen, and say Miss Cora sent you. It
is so dark now the others will not see you.
Hurry.&#8221;</p>

<p>With her brain in a whirl&#8211;wondering upon
what strange mystery she had stumbled, Cora
thrust the woman forth from the stable. Then,
seeing that she advanced toward the house, the
girl groped her way up the stairs to get the extinguisher.
When she came down the fire was
sufficiently conquered as not to need more attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did a rat get you?&#8221; asked Jack. &#8220;Say, you
do look pale, Sis,&#8221; for the electric lights, with
which the garage was illuminated, had been turned
on. Truly Cora seemed white.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are some big ones up there,&#8221; she remarked
evasively, wondering if the woman would
really go to the house.</p>

<p>With unsteady steps the stranger made her way
to the kitchen, where two rather frightened maids
were watching the progress made in fighting the
fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss&#8211;Miss Cora told me to come here&#8211;and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>
wait for her,&#8221; faltered the woman. She
made no effort to ascend the steps of the back
porch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come right in,&#8221; urged Nettie. &#8220;Or perhaps
you would rather sit out here and watch. I&#8217;ll get
you a chair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I would&#8211;thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She walked up and sat down.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;I had rather be out in the air,&#8221; she went
on.</p>

<p>Back in the garage the young people were seeing
that no lingering spark remained.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is all out,&#8221; remarked Bess. &#8220;Oh, but
we&#8217;re so soiled and&#8211;and smoky.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Regular bacon,&#8221; remarked Jack with a grin.
He looked like a minstrel because of the grime.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, wasn&#8217;t it a narrow escape!&#8221; gasped
Belle. &#8220;Could the lightning have struck?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It didn&#8217;t seem so,&#8221; remarked Cora, not now
so nervous. But she was still puzzled over the
presence of that strange woman in the garage
at the time of the fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was gasoline&#8211;whatever else it was,&#8221; declared
Jack. &#8220;I can tell that by the smell.
Maybe some of that we used in an open pan to
clean my machine exploded,&#8221; he went on to his
chums.</p>

<p>&#8220;Could it go off by spontaneous combustion?&#8221;
asked Ed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>
&#8220;It&#8217;s possible,&#8221; admitted Walter. &#8220;Unless
some one was smoking in here&#8211;some tramp.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; protested Cora quickly. The woman
did not seem a tramp&#8211;certainly she did not
smoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must get the cars back in here,&#8221; said
Jack. &#8220;The rain is slackening now.&#8221; This was
so, for the shower, though severe, had not been
of long duration. &#8220;We want them in shape for
to-morrow,&#8221; he went on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are we going after all this?&#8221; asked Belle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly!&#8221; exclaimed Cora. &#8220;This fire
didn&#8217;t amount to much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m much obliged to you,&#8221; spoke Jack to the
passing workmen who had come in to help. Jack
passed them some money.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll help you roll the cars in,&#8221; suggested
one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it will be better to roll them by hand
than take chances on starting them up, and making
sparks,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;Come on, boys!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, girls!&#8221; echoed Cora. &#8220;We&#8217;ll go
to the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>While her brother, his chums and the men were
putting the autos back in the garage the girls ran
through the slackening rain to the rear porch.
There Cora found the strange woman sitting,
pathetically weary, in the chair Nettie had
brought out.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>
&#8220;Oh&#8211;some one is here!&#8221; gasped Belle, who
had nearly stumbled over the figure in the darkness.
Then one of the maids opened the kitchen
door, and a flood of light came out on the porch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a minute, girls,&#8221; said Cora, in a low
voice. &#8220;I think I have a little surprise for you.&#8221;
She motioned to the strange woman.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span><a id='link_3'></a>CHAPTER III<br /><span class='h2fs'>A STRANGE STORY</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Come inside,&#8221; Cora said, while the others
looked on in amazement. Who could this
strange, elderly woman be? Where had she come
from? And Cora appeared to know her.</p>

<p>&#8220;One of Cora&#8217;s charity-cronies,&#8221; Ed whispered
to Norton, who stood inquisitively near. &#8220;Come
on. She knows how to take care of that sort.&#8221;
The boys after putting back the autos had come
on to the house.</p>

<p>Jack and Walter were evidently of Ed&#8217;s opinion,
for they also passed into the house with not
more than a glance at the woman. Bess lingered
near Cora.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will go in here,&#8221; Cora said kindly, as
she opened from the kitchen a door that led into
a room used for special occasions, when many
dishes were served. &#8220;Then I can have a chance
to talk with you. Perhaps you are hungry?&#8221; she
added.</p>

<p>The woman looked about her as if dazed.
Cora saw that she had a face of rather uncommon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>
type. Her deep-set gray eyes were faded
to the very tint of her gray hair, and her cheeks,
though sunken, outlined features that indicated refinement.
Her clothes were very much worn, but
comparatively clean and of good material. She
wore no hat, nor other head covering.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I am hungry, I think,&#8221; the woman said.
&#8220;But I need not keep you from your friends. If
you will just have a cup of tea sent in here to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, they don&#8217;t mind,&#8221; Cora said, with a
laugh. &#8220;My friends can be with me any time.&#8221;
The other girls had gone to get rid of the grime
of the fire, as had the boys.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said the woman. &#8220;You are so
kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cora scarcely heard this for she was out in the
kitchen giving some orders. She soon returned
to the little room, and took a chair opposite her
guest.</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you come to be in the barn?&#8221; she
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I went in&#8211;to rest,&#8221; answered the woman
wearily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; Cora said, as if that were an explanation.
&#8220;But I won&#8217;t ask you to talk any
more until you have had your tea. There,&#8221; as
Nettie placed a tray of refreshment beside her,
&#8220;let me give you your tea first, then you will feel
more like talking.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>
The tea was poured when Jack entered. He
looked at Cora questioningly.</p>

<p>&#8220;This woman was out in the storm,&#8221; Cora
truthfully explained without making a clear statement,
&#8220;and I insisted that she come in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, of course,&#8221; assented the good-natured
brother. &#8220;But say, Cora,&#8221; and he changed the
subject tactfully. &#8220;Wasn&#8217;t it a good thing mother
was not at home? She would have been scared
to death.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I know we always have to get mother
off first,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;When we are arranging
a trip I count on&#8211;happenings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is your brother?&#8221; asked the woman,
who seemed to have revived under the influence
of that cup of tea.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Cora replied. &#8220;Have some of the
ham. And some bread.&#8221;</p>

<p>A particularly sharp flash of lightning blazed
through the room. The storm was not over yet.
The three girls from the parlor threw the door of
the pantry open, and stood there with very white
faces. Even Belle, the rosy one, had gone pale
again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, do come in here,&#8221; wailed Belle. &#8220;I am
so frightened!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With all the others near you?&#8221; Cora asked,
smiling. Then, seeing the actual terror of her
friends she did stand up to comply.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>
&#8220;I suppose it was the fire,&#8221; apologized Eline.
&#8220;We are especially nervous to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, do go,&#8221; begged the woman, &#8220;and when
I have finished, I will show my gratitude by telling
you all a very strange story. One forgets
fear, sometimes, when a matter of deeper interest
is brought up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; assented Cora. &#8220;I will be back
in a few minutes, and then we will all be primed
for the wonderful story.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; whispered Jack in the passage-way,
as the girls entered the library.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; Cora cautioned. &#8220;I found her&#8211;in
the barn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The barn! Before the fire?&#8221; he gasped.
&#8220;Did she&#8213;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;After it was&#8211;going,&#8221; Cora managed to say.
Then she put her finger to her lips.</p>

<p>The young folks, at least the girls, insisted
upon huddling in the very darkest corner of the
room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go near the phonograph,&#8221; cautioned
Eline. &#8220;Musical sounds are very dangerous during
a storm, I&#8217;ve heard.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the absurdity of &#8220;musical sounds&#8221; from
a silent phonograph occurred to her, and she
laughed as quickly as did the others.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well it&#8217;s metal at any rate,&#8221; she amended,
&#8220;and that is just as bad.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>
&#8220;Who&#8217;s your friend, Cora?&#8221; Ed asked, in an
off-hand way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, she is going to tell us a wonderful story,&#8221;
put in Bess before Cora could reply. &#8220;Wait until
she has finished her tea.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She looks like a deserted wife,&#8221; Belle ventured
softly, in her usual strain of romance.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the indication?&#8221; asked Walter somewhat
facetiously. &#8220;Now, do I look anything like
a deserted lover?&#8221;</p>

<p>Cora got up and went out into the pantry
again. She found the woman standing, waiting
for her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know if I was wise or foolish to have
made that promise,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But as I have
made it I will stand by it. I feel also that to
talk will do me good. And, after all, what have
I to fear more than I have already suffered?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have no idea of insisting on your confidence,&#8221;
Cora assured her. &#8220;But, of course, I
would like to know why you went in <i>our</i> garage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I fully intend to tell you,&#8221; replied the
woman. &#8220;Are you all young folks?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just now, we are alone,&#8221; answered Cora.
&#8220;We are going away to-morrow, and were finishing
our arrangements when the barn caught fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I scarcely look fit to enter your&#8211;other room,&#8221;
the woman demurred, with a glance at her worn
clothing. &#8220;But I assure you I have been no place
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span>
where there has been illness, or anything of that
sort.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are all right,&#8221; insisted Cora. &#8220;Come
along. I am sure the girls are more frightened
than ever now, for the storm is more furious.&#8221;
The thunder and lightning seemed to be having
&#8220;a second spasm,&#8221; as Jack put it.</p>

<p>A hush fell upon the little party as the strange
woman entered. Even the careless one, Norton,
looked serious. Somehow the presence of a gray-haired,
lonely woman, in that unusually merry
crowd, seemed almost a painful contrast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit here,&#8221; said Cora, pulling a chair out in a
convenient position. &#8220;And won&#8217;t you take off
your cape?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, thank you,&#8221; replied the stranger. &#8220;I
must talk while I feel like it, or I might disappoint
you.&#8221; This was said with a smile, and the
young folks noted that though the woman showed
agitation, her eyes were now bright, and her voice
firm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; Cora acceded. Then the woman
told her strange story.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some time ago I was employed in an office.
I had charge of the cataloging of confidential
papers. I had been with the firm only a short
time, when one day,&#8221; she paused abruptly, &#8220;one
day I was very busy.</p>

<p>&#8220;A big piece of business had just been transacted,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>
and there was a lot of ready cash in the
office. It was my duty to see that the record of
all finished business was entered in the books, and
I was intent upon that task.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again she paused, and in the interval there
came a flame of lightning followed by a roar of
thunder.</p>

<p>&#8220;My, what a storm!&#8221; gasped the woman.
&#8220;I&#8217;m glad I am not out in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The remark seemed pathetic, and served to
distract the most nervous of the girls from a
fear that they otherwise would have felt.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are glad you are with us,&#8221; Belle ventured,
as Cora hastened out into the kitchen, to make
sure that all was right there.</p>

<p>The maids had been startled. Nettie was assuring
a new girl that thunder storms were never
disastrous in Chelton, but the latter had suddenly
become prayerful, and would not answer the simplest
questions. Assuring herself that Nettie
could take care of the girl and two newly hired
men, who had assembled in the kitchen, Cora
went back to the library.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that day,&#8221; continued the woman,
&#8220;marked my life-doom. As I worked over my
books, and counted the money, I saw two men
standing in the door. A young girl clerk&#8211;Nancy
Ford&#8211;was nearest to them. As she saw them she
screamed, and darted past them out&#8211;out somewhere
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span>
in this big world, and I have never been
able to find her since.&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman put up both hands to cover her
pallid face, and sighed heavily. No one spoke.
Eline had shifted her chair, unconsciously, very
near the stranger, and sat with rapt attention
waiting for the continuation of the story.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; went on the woman, &#8220;when Nancy
Ford was gone I saw the men come toward me!
I screamed, put my hand upon the cash I was
counting&#8211;and then&#8211;they hit me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; gasped Cora, involuntarily. &#8220;They
robbed you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, they robbed me!&#8221; repeated the woman.
&#8220;Not only of my employer&#8217;s money, but of my
reputation, for the story I told afterward was not
believed!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How dreadful!&#8221; exclaimed Bess, clasping her
hands.</p>

<p>The boys, less demonstrative, did not interrupt
with a single syllable. But they were impressed,
nevertheless.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I was discharged! I was shocked into
a nervous collapse, and ever since I have been
searching for Nancy Ford. Why did she run before
any harm was done? Why did she flee at
the sight of the men, who showed no indication of
being robbers? Why did Nancy Ford not return
to clear my name? I went to the hospital and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>
was there for months. Oh, such terrible months!
I was threatened with brain fever, from that mental
searching for Nancy, but she never returned!&#8221;</p>

<p>Belle was stirred to sympathy by the recital, and,
while no one saw her, brushed by the woman&#8217;s
chair and slid into the gaping pocket of her cape
her own little silver purse.</p>

<p>&#8220;My name is Margaret Raymond&#8211;Mrs. Raymond.
I am a widow,&#8221; went on the woman finally,
&#8220;and I am not ashamed or afraid now to
have the world know who I am. I loved Nancy:
she was almost like a daughter to me, and I
would have trusted her with anything. But now&#8211;she
has deserted me! And no one else can
ever clear my name!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No one else?&#8221; Cora repeated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some of the firm members believed my story,
but it was vague and one could scarcely blame
them for doubting it,&#8221; said Mrs. Raymond.</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t it look bad for the girl?&#8221; Jack asked.
&#8220;She ran away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it did, but a girl somehow has a better
chance than an old woman,&#8221; said Mrs. Raymond
sadly, though she was not so very old. &#8220;They
thought she was scared into flight, and afraid to
come back. Oh, when sympathy is on one&#8217;s side
it is easy to make excuses! I was on my way
to look for work when the storm overtook me.
I went in your garage. My hat blew away.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>&#8220;We will do anything we can to assist you,&#8221;
Cora declared. &#8220;Your story seems true, and we
have the advantage of some leisure time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And a good heart, besides brains,&#8221; the woman
said emphatically. &#8220;My child, you have a great
chance in life. May no misfortunes rob you of
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The storm had moderated somewhat. The
strain of the strange story made a deep impression
upon the listeners, and the young men, quick
to realize this effect upon their girl friends, now
proposed that they all go outside and see &#8220;what
the weather looked like.&#8221;</p>

<p>Anxious to know the prospects for the long auto
tour they were to take on the following morning,
all now hurried to the side porch, leaving the
woman alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;My, isn&#8217;t it beautiful!&#8221; exclaimed Eline.
&#8220;How sweet everything smells!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that little breeze,&#8221; said Ed, &#8220;will soon
dry up the mud. I am glad it did not rain longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it did,&#8221; added Walter, &#8220;we would have
to load up with planks to bridge over the bad
places. Can&#8217;t depend on rail fences over where
we&#8217;re going.&#8221;</p>

<p>For some time they stood admiring the newly-made
beauties of the wonderful out-doors, then
Cora thought perhaps she might arrange for Mrs.
Raymond to stay in the servants&#8217; quarters over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>
night. They had left the woman rather abruptly,
she feared.</p>

<p>Cora asked Jack what he thought, and he
agreed that the woman&#8217;s story sounded plausible,
and that it was their duty to do what they could
to assist her, if they could. But he did not seem
very keen.</p>

<p>With the intention of asking Mrs. Raymond to
remain, Cora left the others and went back to the
library.</p>

<p>No one was in the room!</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps she went into the kitchen,&#8221; Cora
thought, opening the door through the hallway
to that room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Mrs. Raymond; the strange
woman?&#8221; she asked Nettie.</p>

<p>&#8220;She did not come out here,&#8221; replied the maid.
&#8220;Isn&#8217;t she with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, we left her in the library,&#8221; Cora replied,
and without further inquiry she looked down the
driveway and could just see a vanishing shadow
turn into the road. But it may not have been
Mrs. Raymond.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess she&#8217;s gone,&#8221; continued Cora to Nettie.
&#8220;And I am sorry, for we wanted to keep her for
the night. Well, I hope the poor creature was
cheered up some. She seemed to need encouragement.
We did all we could, perhaps.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is she gone?&#8221; asked Bess, when they all had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span>
come in again, having satisfied themselves that
fine weather was promised for the morning. &#8220;I
hoped she would tell us more about the Ford girl&#8211;give
us a description of her, at least. We might
run across her somewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It all seemed rather weird,&#8221; said Cora. &#8220;But
really we must be on the lookout. Who knows
but we may help unravel the mystery?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why did the woman hurry off so?&#8221; asked
Belle, as if any one present knew.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose she thought we might think she
caused the fire,&#8221; Ed answered. &#8220;It looked
strange for her to be in the barn at that time.
But anyone could see that it was a small explosion&#8211;too
much gas somewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, all we know about Nancy is her name,&#8221;
observed Cora. &#8220;We will have to trust to motor
girls&#8217; luck for the rest. But I love a mystery.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; Eline declared, &#8220;if we could
have the wonderful luck to find that girl we might
be able to clear the poor woman&#8217;s name. It
looked to me as if the girl was in league with the
robbers when she ran before they entered the
room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No use speculating,&#8221; Cora commented.
&#8220;Better finish our arrangements. It&#8217;s getting
late.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span><a id='link_4'></a>CHAPTER IV<br /><span class='h2fs'>ON THE ROAD</span></h2>

<p>There was more &#8220;finishing&#8221; to be done than
even Cora had thought, and, with her usual habit
of looking after matters, she had counted on much.
But the thunder-shower, the fire, the finding of the
strange woman, and listening to her still more
strange story all combined to make the affair of
getting ready for the trip in the morning no easy
one.</p>

<p>But Cora was determined to carry out the plans
as agreed on, so when her friends showed a disposition
to delay, and dwell in conversation on the
recent happenings, she &#8220;brought them up with a
round turn,&#8221; as Jack expressed it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I just can&#8217;t get over that queer woman,&#8221; observed
Belle, during a lull in the talk, while Cora
was jotting down in a pretty red leather notebook
some matters she did not want to forget.
&#8220;She had such&#8211;such a patient face.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe she was tired of waiting for a new
one,&#8221; suggested Norton, who was usually flippant.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard that ladies can get new faces at these&#8211;er&#8211;beauty
parlors.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a pity there isn&#8217;t some sort of a parlor
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>
where one can get&#8211;manners!&#8221; murmured Eline.
She seemed to have taken a distinct dislike to the
new young man.</p>

<p>Belle and Bess, who had overheard the remark,
looked rather askance at Cora&#8217;s relative, but said
nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now then!&#8221; exclaimed the young hostess,
&#8220;since you have all gotten rid of as much of the
effects of the fire as possible, we&#8217;ll go over the
main points to be sure nothing will go wrong.
Oh, that&#8217;s something I almost forgot. I must
send mamma our address.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Kimball had gone to Europe for a summer
tour, leaving her daughter and son at home. When
they went to the Cove the house would be in
charge of a care-taker. Cora had not fully determined
on her vacation plans when her mother
went away, and now there was necessity for forwarding
the address.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll attend to that the last thing to-night,&#8221;
Cora went on. &#8220;I&#8217;ll send mother a long letter,
and write again as soon as we get settled at the
Cove.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If we ever <i>do</i> get settled,&#8221; murmured Walter.
&#8220;Say, boys, am I any less&#8211;hammy?&#8221; and he
sniffed at his coat about which still lingered the
smell of gasoline.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re of the ham&#8211;saltiest&#8211;or hammiest!&#8221;
declared Ed.</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span>&#8220;You may break, you may burn the garage if you will</p>
<p>The taste of the gasoline stays with it still.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>It was Walter who mis-quoted this couplet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, boys, please do be quiet!&#8221; begged Cora.
&#8220;We will never get anything done if you don&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It strikes me we got considerable done a short
time ago, when we put that fire out,&#8221; remarked
Jack. Cora looked sharply at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be good, Sis&#8211;don&#8217;t shoot&#8211;I&#8217;m coming
down,&#8221; he exclaimed, and he &#8220;slumped&#8221; at Eline&#8217;s
feet and made a fruitless endeavor to hold her
slim, pretty hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; she commanded with a blush.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s my privilege!&#8221; called Ed, as he made
a quick move, but the visitor from the Windy City
escaped by getting behind Bess, who was in the
Roman chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t&#8213;&#8221; began Cora determinedly,
and then she changed her tone. &#8220;Please&#8213;&#8221;
she pleaded.</p>

<p>&#8220;After that&#8211;nothing but silence!&#8221; came from
Walter. &#8220;Go easy, boys!&#8221;</p>

<p>Silence did reign&#8211;or, considering the shower,
might one not say &#8220;rain&#8221; for a moment? Cora
resumed.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are to start as early in the morning as
possible,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I figured&#8211;or rather Jack
and Ed did&#8211;that the trip to Sandy Point Cove
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>
would take about three days&#8211;perhaps four if&#8211;if
anything happened like tire trouble. But we
are in no hurry, and we can spend five days on the
road if we like.</p>

<p>&#8220;My cousin, Mrs. Fordam, will go along with
us as a chaperone, so that stopping at hotels will
be perfectly&#8211;proper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought it was always proper to stop at
a hotel&#8211;when you had the price!&#8221; ventured
Jack.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t understand,&#8221; declared his sister,
giving him a look. &#8220;So Cousin Mary will be
on the trip with us. I guess you all know her,
except Eline and Norton. She&#8217;s jolly and funny.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why can&#8217;t she go right on to the Cove with
us, and chaperone there, too?&#8221; Belle wanted to
know.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because Mamma&#8217;s aunt&#8211;Mrs. Susan Chester&#8211;is
to look after us there. You&#8217;ll like Aunt
Susan, I&#8217;m sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are we to call her that?&#8221; Ed asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course&#8211;she won&#8217;t mind,&#8221; spoke Cora.
&#8220;Well, as I said, we&#8217;ll go to the Cove&#8211;taking
whatever time we please. There are two bungalows
there, you know, and we girls are to have
the larger one, so&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I like that!&#8221; cried Jack, sitting up.
&#8220;As if we fellows could dress in a band-box.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, your place is plenty big enough&#8211;you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>
know it is!&#8221; retorted his sister. &#8220;And you know
when you and I went down to look at them you
said you liked the smaller one best, anyhow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did I?&#8221; inquired Jack, slightly bewildered.</p>

<p>&#8220;You certainly did!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now will you be good?&#8221; laughed Walter.</p>

<p>&#8220;We girls need more room anyhow,&#8221; was the
opinion of Bess, calmly given.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing more to say,&#8221; declared Ed, sententiously.
&#8220;I know how many dresses each of you
is going to take now. Slay on, Macbeth!&#8221; and
he closed his eyes resignedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything will be ready for us at the bungalows,&#8221;
went on Cora. &#8220;Aunt Susan has promised
to see to that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about&#8211;er&#8211;grub&#8211;not to put too fine
a point upon it?&#8221; asked Jack.</p>

<p>&#8220;The refreshments will be there,&#8221; Cora answered,
pointedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh my! Listen to that!&#8221; mocked Ed.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to put on our glad rags for dinner
every night, fellows&#8211;notice that&#8211;I said dinner!
Ahem!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please be quiet!&#8221; begged Cora. &#8220;Now
we&#8217;re at the bungalows,&#8221; and she consulted her
list.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come out for a swim&#8221; cried Walter, imitating
a seal, and barking like one.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean in imagination,&#8221; added Cora.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>
&#8220;There, I think that is all. Our trunks and suit
cases are nearly packed, Cousin Mary will be
here later to-night, ready to start in the morning
with us. Our route is all mapped out, and I guess
we can count on a good time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are the bungalows near the beach?&#8221; asked
Eline.</p>

<p>&#8220;Almost on it,&#8221; answered Cora. &#8220;At high
tide and with the wind on shore the spray comes
on the porches!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh dear!&#8221; exclaimed Belle, apprehensively.
&#8220;I know&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going to learn to swim, you promised!&#8221;
cried Cora. &#8220;Can anyone think of anything
else?&#8221;</p>

<p>They all could, and promptly proceeded to do
so, a perfect babel of talk ensuing. Some forgotten
points were jotted down and then, as it
was getting late, the young people dispersed,
promising to meet early in the morning. It had
stopped raining when they went out, so there was
no need to hunt up umbrellas.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cora,&#8221; said Jack, a bit solemnly, as he was
helping her lock up for the night, &#8220;was there anything
about that strange woman that you didn&#8217;t
tell us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a thing, Jack, except that I discovered
her in the stairway that time I screamed, and I let
you think it was a rat. Then I told her to hurry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>
in the house without being seen. I saw she was
in no condition to talk then. That was all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good for you, Sis. You managed it all right.
But I would like to get at the bottom of her
trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So would I. Perhaps we may&#8211;later. Good-night,&#8221;
and they separated.</p>

<p>The next day was all that could be wished for.
The sun shone with revived and determined energy,
as it always seems to after a rain, when it
&#8220;has been deprived of its proper set the night
before,&#8221; to quote Jack. The roads had dried up
nicely, and everything pointed to a most delightful
trip.</p>

<p>An investigation by Jack in the daytime proved
that the fire had done very little damage to the
barn. A close inspection seemed to indicate that
spontaneous combustion of some gasoline carelessly
left in an open can had caused it. Jack&#8217;s
car was not enough scorched to be more than
barely noticeable from the rear.</p>

<p>Cousin Mary had arrived on time, and helped
Cora get ready. Jack ran the three cars out of
the stable before his friends arrived, and had
them ready for the passengers. Gasoline and oil
tanks had been filled the day before, and the motors
gone over to insure as perfect service as possible.
Tires had also been looked after.</p>

<p>Jack and Ed were to go together in the former&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>
<i>Get There</i>, Cora, in her big maroon <i>Whirlwind</i>
would have Eline as her passenger, the tonneau
being taken up with luggage.</p>

<p>Norton Randolf, who owned a small, but powerful
car, had invited Walter to go with him, Norton
being included in the invitation to go &#8220;bungaloafing
by the sea,&#8221; as Jack characterized it.
He was really good company after one had become
used to some of his mannerisms. The
Robinson twins, of course, would use their own
car. The girls, including Cora, were no longer
amateur motorists, but could drive their machines
with a skill equal to that of the boys.</p>

<p>Norton arrived soon after Walter and Ed, coming
up in his car, which was kept in a public garage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is your cousin going to ride, Cora?&#8221;
asked Belle, as they hurried the final preparations.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how you can get her in your
machine, with those trunks and things in the tonneau.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so!&#8221; exclaimed Cora, with a tragic
gesture. &#8220;I knew I had forgotten something. I
had down on my notes &#8216;Cousin Mary&#8211;where?&#8217;
and I took it to mean where would I put her to
sleep. I see now it was where should I put her
to ride.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let her come with us!&#8221; exclaimed Bess.
&#8220;You can take one of our suit cases in your car,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>
and that will leave plenty of room for your
cousin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess that&#8217;s all we can do now,&#8221; said
Cora. &#8220;Oh, dear, I thought I had fixed everything!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t fuss, my dear!&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Fordam.
&#8220;It will be all right. Your car is so big
that I&#8217;m really afraid of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>So it was arranged, and when a few other forgotten
matters had been settled, Cora gave the
last instructions to the care-taker of the Kimball
home, and blew a blast on her auto horn as a
signal to start.</p>

<p>&#8220;At last we are off!&#8221; sighed Eline, as she sat
beside Cora. &#8220;It seems as if time moves slowest
of all at the end.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It really does,&#8221; agreed Cora. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad
we are able to start. When I saw that blaze in
the garage&#8211;Oh, my dear, you&#8217;ve no idea how my
heart sank. It almost stopped beating.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can imagine so. What a pretty suit you
have,&#8221; and she glanced admiringly at Cora&#8217;s smart
motoring costume. It was a light biscuit shade,
of a material that would stand wear, and not show
the stains of travel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your own is fully as pretty&#8211;perhaps a little
too nice,&#8221; returned Cora. Eline had made rather
elaborate preparations for her Eastern trip, as
regarded dress. But she was within good taste,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>
for she ran much to harmonizing shades&#8211;perhaps
too much so.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are we going at this snail&#8217;s pace all day?&#8221;
cried Jack to his sister. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you move
faster?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We want the good people of Chelton to have
a chance to admire us,&#8221; called Belle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall we pass her?&#8221; asked Norton of Walter.
&#8220;My car can easily get ahead of the <i>Whirlwind</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t do it,&#8221; Walter advised. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe
Cora would like it. And really, she arranged
this affair, so she ought to make the pace.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; assented the new lad, and he had
the good sense to see the wisdom of the advice.</p>

<p>They passed the Robinson home, the twins waving
and being waved at, and then the four autos
turned out on the main road that led into a glorious
country&#8211;a country doubly glorious this morning
because of the rain of the night before.</p>

<p>They were really on the road at last, and as
Cora glanced down it, her gloved hands firm on
the steering wheel, she could not help wondering
if it was this road that the strange and perhaps
misunderstood woman had taken when she fled so
silently from the Kimball house. Also Cora wondered
if she would ever meet her again. The
chances were against it and yet&#8213;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really so many strange things have happened
to us on some of our auto trips,&#8221; she explained
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span>
to Eline as they talked it over, &#8220;that I would
not be surprised if we did see her again&#8211;and
perhaps&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Even that Nancy Ford!&#8221; supplied Eline.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that would be too much to expect, my
dear!&#8221; said Cora, with a laugh. &#8220;We turn
here!&#8221; she added, &#8220;just hold out your hand,
Eline.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold out my hand?&#8221; Eline asked, wonderingly,
as she stretched it straight out in front of
her. &#8220;What for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I mean out at the side of the car,&#8221; explained
Cora. &#8220;It is a sign to whoever is coming
behind that you are going to turn. It prevents
accidents.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I see,&#8221; and this time the Chicago girl
did it properly.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span><a id='link_5'></a>CHAPTER V<br /><span class='h2fs'>A FLOCK OF SHEEP</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;What a delightful road!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it splendid!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Too perfect!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Cora who made the first remark, Eline
who answered and the Robinson twins who chorused
the third. The highway was so wide, and
there was so little traffic thus early in the morning,
that the two cars could run side by side. On high
gear with the gas throttled down they made
scarcely any noise, so that conversation was possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what I have done to enjoy such
pleasure,&#8221; said Mrs. Fordam.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you really enjoying it, Cousin Mary?&#8221;
inquired Cora.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed I am, my dear! I wouldn&#8217;t have
missed it for a good deal. I never knew before
how delightful it was to be chaperone to such
nice girls.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I can&#8217;t stop steering long enough
to pass you a chocolate candy!&#8221; exclaimed Bess.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span>
&#8220;Belle, you will have to do it for me. Such
compliments!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I really mean it,&#8221; declared Mrs. Fordam,
earnestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait until the boys begin to cut up,&#8221; warned
Cora.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I know Jack of old,&#8221; returned the chaperone.
&#8220;He can&#8217;t do anything very bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They seem to be hatching up some sort of a
plot back there,&#8221; remarked Eline, as she looked
to the rear where Jack&#8217;s gaudy red and yellow
car was careening alongside the <i>Beetle</i>&#8211;that
owned by Norton. It had been so christened because
of its low, rakish appearance, and the fact
that it was painted a dead black. It was not a
pretty car, but it had speed, as Norton often
boasted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve no doubt they will do something,&#8221;
conceded Belle. &#8220;But we can do things too!&#8221;</p>

<p>They ran on for some distance, this stretch
of the road being particularly fine. They were
under a perfect arch of maple trees, which, being
planted on either side of the road, mingled their
branches over the centre, affording a delightful
shade. It was needed, too, in a measure, for the
sun, creeping higher and higher in the blue sky,
was sending down beams of heat, as well as light.
There was gentle wind, which was accentuated by
the motion of the machines.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>&#8220;Is it hard to learn to drive a car?&#8221; asked
Eline, as Bess and Belle combined in telling Mrs.
Fordam something of the excitement of the previous
night, she not having arrived until it was
over.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is, my dear, at first,&#8221; Cora explained.
&#8220;Then it all seems to come to you at once. Why
you&#8217;d never believe it, but first I used to imagine
I was going to hit everything on the road. I
gave objects such a wide berth that everyone
laughed at me. But I did not want to take
chances. Now watch!&#8221;</p>

<p>She speeded up a little, and turning to one side
seemed to be headed straight for a tree.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; screamed Eline, and Bess and Belle
echoed the cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; cried Cora, as she skillfully passed
it, far enough off for safety, as even the most
careful motorist would admit, but near enough
to make an amateur nervous. &#8220;You see what
it is to have confidence,&#8221; she added to Eline.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; was the somewhat doubtful comment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cora, dear, I wouldn&#8217;t take those risks if I
were you,&#8221; rebuked her Cousin Mary, gently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it wasn&#8217;t a risk at all! I had perfect
control. I just wanted to show Eline what practice
will do. I am going to teach her to drive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll never learn!&#8221; was the nervous protest.</p>

<p>The road narrowed about a mile farther on,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>
but before the cars lengthened out into single file
again, Belle asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are we to lunch, Cora?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I planned on stopping at Mooreville. There
is a nice, home-like restaurant there. We&#8217;ll be
in Churchton soon, and we can stop there and
&#8217;phone in to have a meal ready for a party of
nine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That would be a good idea.&#8221;</p>

<p>Churchton was soon reached, and Jack found
he had a puncture. While he stopped to put a
new inner tube into service Cora got the restaurant
on the wire and made arrangements.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now will you please be good?&#8221; Jack begged
of his car, when the tire had been pumped up
again. &#8220;This is a bad beginning for you, old
<i>Get There</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it makes good you can tack on another title
when we&#8217;re in Chelton again,&#8221; suggested Ed.</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Call it <i>Get There and Back</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe I will!&#8221; laughed Jack. &#8220;Sorry to
delay you,&#8221; he said to the others, for they waited
for him after Cora had finished telephoning.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right,&#8221; spoke Walter, good-naturedly.
&#8220;We have plenty of time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more they were under way. The road
was now not so good, and in places positively bad.
But they knew they would soon be on better
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>
ground, and on a fine highway leading into Mooreville.</p>

<p>Later they were on a narrow thoroughfare, so
narrow, and with such deep ditches on either side,
that it would take no small skill to pass another
vehicle in certain places. Then, as Cora made a
turn, the road ahead being hidden by a thick
growth of trees, she saw straggling along the
highway a big flock of sheep, tended by a man
and two beautiful collie dogs. The fleecy animals
straggled and spread out over the whole
road.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh dear!&#8221; Cora cried, as she slowed down.
&#8220;Isn&#8217;t this provoking! We can&#8217;t get past them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; asked Eline.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because they are so&#8211;so straggly. They
take up the whole road, and if I tried to pass I&#8217;d
be sure to run over one of them. Oh! what a
shame!</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to take it slowly!&#8221; she called back
to the twins, who were just behind her. &#8220;I can&#8217;t
take a chance of threading my way through all
these animals.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is tough luck!&#8221; complained Jack, as he
saw what the trouble was.</p>

<p>The herder looked up stolidly, puffing on a
short pipe, and called to one of the dogs, who
leaped off to drive back into the flock a sheep
that showed a propensity to lag behind.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you try to pass them?&#8221; asked Eline.
&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you could do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather not,&#8221; answered Cora.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you dare!&#8221; cautioned Bess, who heard
what was said.</p>

<p>&#8220;But we&#8217;ll be late for lunch&#8211;and it has been
ordered,&#8221; wailed Belle. &#8220;And I&#8217;m so hungry!&#8221;</p>

<p>Cora resolved on an appeal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think you could drive your sheep to
one side, and keep them there until we passed?&#8221;
she asked the man. &#8220;It will take us only a minute
to shoot by.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be a risky undertaking miss,&#8221; the
herder answered respectfully enough. &#8220;Sheep is
queer critters. You think you&#8217;ve got &#8217;em just
where you want &#8217;em, when, all to once they break
out, and if one goes the others follow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know!&#8221; Cora was genuinely distressed.
&#8220;But we simply must get past!&#8221; she exclaimed.
&#8220;Can&#8217;t you think of a way?&#8221; She looked ahead
at the sheep. There were a hundred or more&#8211;quite
a flock. The herder took off his cap and
scratched his head reflectively&#8211;looking the while
meditatively at his pipe.</p>

<p>&#8220;It might be done&#8211;it might,&#8221; he murmured.</p>

<p>Cora brought her car to a stop.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; cried Bess and Belle together, and Bess,
who was driving, jammed on the foot and emergency
brake quicker than she ever had in her life
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>
before. As it was her fender struck the rear tires
of Cora&#8217;s car.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh dear!&#8221; wailed Eline, clutching at Cora,
while Belle, recovering from her momentary
fright, had the presence of mind to raise her arm
in the air as a signal for the boys to come to a
halt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cora Kimball!&#8221; cried Bess. &#8220;What did you
stop so suddenly for, and not signal us? We
might have broken your car!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. But I just thought of something,
so didn&#8217;t think of signalling. Any damage done?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but there might have been.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right then. Will you please come here?&#8221;
she called to the man. &#8220;I want to speak to you&#8211;that
is, if the sheep will be all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, miss, the dogs will look after &#8217;em,&#8221; and,
calling a command to the intelligent collies, he
advanced toward Cora&#8217;s car.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span><a id='link_6'></a>CHAPTER VI<br /><span class='h2fs'>JACK IS LOST</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;How many sheep have you?&#8221; asked Cora.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s just a hundred and ten, miss. I
had a hundred and &#8217;leven, but one died on me,&#8221;
the man explained.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is this&#8211;a class in arithmetic?&#8221; inquired
Jack, who had left his car and come up to where
his sister sat in hers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Jack&#8211;please&#8213;&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;And how much farther does this road go before&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The road doesn&#8217;t go&#8211;it stays right here!&#8221;
chuckled her brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop it!&#8221; she commanded in such a tone that
he knew she meant it.</p>

<p>&#8220;How far before there is a cross-road into
which you could turn your sheep?&#8221; went on Cora,
fixing the man with what Jack said afterward was
&#8220;a cold and fishy glance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A matter of four mile, miss.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought so. Then we&#8217;d have to tag along
behind you all that distance, losing time, and&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>&#8220;To say nothing of swallowing all that dust!&#8221;
exclaimed Belle, pointing to a cloud of it that hung
over the flock of sheep, which the dogs were skillfully
herding. &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s awful!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve thought of a way out,&#8221; spoke
Cora.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then <i>out</i> with it, Sis!&#8221; exclaimed the irrepressible
Jack. Once more his sister turned her
attention to him&#8211;this time it was only a look,
but it sufficed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you see that field over there?&#8221; asked Cora
of the sheep man, pointing to one rich and luxuriant
in deep, green grass.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, miss, I see it,&#8221; and he pointed with the
stem of his pipe to be sure he made no mistake.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Well, now, could you take your sheep
in there, and keep them&#8211;er&#8211;quiet&#8211;until we
passed in our autos. You see it is impossible for
us to get by on the road, for even if you did get
the animals to one side one might leap out, under
the wheels of a car and there would be an accident.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see, miss. The sheep might be killed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and we&#8217;d be wrecked,&#8221; growled Jack.
&#8220;What&#8217;s the game, Sis? If we stay here much
longer that dinner will be eaten by some one else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be quiet Jack&#8211;please! Now could you not
drive your sheep into the field?&#8221; she asked.
&#8220;Then we could get past. Of course we might
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>
turn around and go back to some other road,
but it would delay us. Could you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Certainly no mere man could withstand the
appealing glance thrown at this humble sheep herder.
He capitulated.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess I could do it, miss. But what if the
man who owns this field was to see me? You see
I&#8217;m a stranger in these parts&#8211;I&#8217;m only hired to
drive these sheep to the man that bought them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see. Well, if we gave you a dollar or so,
you could give it to the man who owns that pasture
in case he made objection. It would be worth
two dollars to get past.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;More,&#8221; Jack framed with his lips, but he did
not speak aloud, being a careful and frugal youth.</p>

<p>&#8220;The sheep could not eat much grass in the
short time you drove them into the field, kept
them there until we got past, and then let &#8217;em out
again; could they?&#8221; she asked, with a winning
smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, miss, I guess I can do it. Sheep is queer.
They is easily frightened, and maybe it would be
the best way. Why, only last night, when I had
turned &#8217;em into a pasture they near ran off on me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; asked Jack, rather idly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you see it was this way. I had &#8217;em all
settled for the night, a matter of several miles
back, when a woman came running along the road.
She was takin&#8217; on somethin&#8217; bad, cryin&#8217; like, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>
mutterin&#8217; &#8216;Kin I ever find her? Kin I ever find
her?&#8217; You see&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was that what she said?&#8221; cried Cora excitedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;She did, miss!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What sort of a woman was she?&#8221; With
her eyes Cora signalled to Jack to remain quiet.
She knew the girls would.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I couldn&#8217;t rightly say, miss, as it was so
dark right after the storm. But before I knew
what she was doin&#8217; she had come into the pasture
that I hired for the sheep over night, and run
toward a hay stack. She stumbled over a lamb,
fell down, the dogs barked, and it took all I could
do to quiet them sheep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What became of the woman?&#8221; asked Cora,
making a motion with her lips to signify that she
thought her the same mysterious one who had
been in her barn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, she was real sorry for having made me
so much trouble, and it <i>was</i> trouble. She said she
didn&#8217;t see the sheep in the field, and she was as
scar&#8217;t as they was, I reckon. I asked her what she
was doin&#8217; out and she said looking for a girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A girl?&#8221; asked Jack, sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I ast her if it was her girl&#8211;thinkin&#8217;
she might be a farmer&#8217;s wife from around there,
but she didn&#8217;t say any more. Only she kept sort
of moanin&#8217; like, an&#8217; sayin&#8217; as how her life was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>
spoilt, an&#8217; how if she could only find a girl&#8211;well,
I couldn&#8217;t make much head or tail of it, an&#8217; anyhow
I was worried about the sheep, for one got
torn on a barbed wire fence. But I was sorry
for the woman. I ast her if she intended to
spend the night out-doors, and she said yes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t hardly stand for that&#8211;for by her
voice I could tell she wasn&#8217;t a common kind. So
I ast her if she had any money. I was goin&#8217;
to give her some myself, so she could get a night&#8217;s
lodging anyhow. She put her hand in her pocket&#8211;sort
of absent-minded like, and then she got a
surprise, I guess, for she pulled out a silver purse,
that she didn&#8217;t seem to expect to find there. I
could see it plain for I was lightin&#8217; my pipe just
then to quiet my nerves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A silver purse?&#8221; cried Cora.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ahem!&#8221; coughed Belle, meaningly, and Cora,
looking at her, understood there was something to
be told&#8211;later.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, a silver purse,&#8221; went on the man. &#8220;She
didn&#8217;t appear to know she had it, and when she
opened it and saw some bills and silver, she was
more struck than ever. She said something about
not knowing it was there, and then she cried out:
&#8216;Oh, it must have been them dear girls! God
bless &#8217;em!&#8217; That&#8217;s the words she used, miss.
I remember &#8217;em well.&#8221;</p>

<p>The others had left their cars now, and come
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>
up to hear the recital. The boys looked meaningly
at one another, and the girls exchanged
glances.</p>

<p>&#8220;What happened next?&#8221; asked Cora.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, nothin&#8217; much, miss. You see the woman
had money though she didn&#8217;t know it, which
I took to be queer. But it wa&#8217;n&#8217;t none of my
affair. She gave me good-night and went back
to the road, walkin&#8217; off in the direction of the
town. I guess she got lodging all right&#8211;she
could go to a hotel with that money. It was more
than I carry. But the sheep was all right by then,
quieted down, so I left &#8217;em to my dogs and crawled
under the hay. I slept good, too.</p>

<p>&#8220;But now, miss, I want to oblige you an&#8217; your
friends, so I&#8217;ll just drive my animals into that
field. I don&#8217;t believe the owner will care.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, take this in case he does,&#8221; said Cora,
passing over a two-dollar bill. &#8220;Get ready now,
people!&#8221; she cried gaily. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to
move!&#8221;</p>

<p>With the aid of the beautiful collies, who
seemed to be able to do everything but talk, the
herder drove his sheep through the lowered bars
of the pasture.</p>

<p>Then, with the bars up again, so they could not
come out, the man waved for the auto to proceed,
swinging his cap at the boys and girls in token
of good will. Cora&#8217;s <i>Whirlwind</i> speeded up, followed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>
by the others, and soon they were on the
broad, level highway that led to Mooreville.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cora, I simply must speak or I&#8217;ll&#8213;&#8221; began
Bess.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t burst!&#8221; cautioned Jack, running his car
up alongside his sister&#8217;s. The road was wide
enough for three for a short distance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t that the same woman who was at your
house?&#8221; went on Bess.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure of it,&#8221; assented Cora. &#8220;Only I
didn&#8217;t want to speak of it before him, Poor
creature! What a plight to be in! No place to
stay!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But that silver purse!&#8221; cried Bess. &#8220;And
the money&#8213;&#8221; She stopped suddenly and
looked at her sister. &#8220;Belle Robinson, you never
gave that to her!&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes I did,&#8221; admitted Belle. &#8220;I slipped it
into the pocket of her cloak. I could see she
needed it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Bread upon the waters,&#8217;&#8221; quoted Cora. &#8220;I
was wondering where she got it when the man
mentioned it. To think of hearing about her
again. Girls, I&#8217;m sure she must be, in some way,
tragically mixed up in our lives. We are destined
to meet her again, I&#8217;m sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I can&#8217;t afford another silver purse,&#8221; said
Belle, smiling. &#8220;It will have to be plain leather
next time.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>&#8220;We&#8217;ll all chip in,&#8221; declared Jack.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we must make time now,&#8221; asserted
Cora.</p>

<p>They found a rather anxious restaurant keeper
looking down the road up which they came, but
he became all smiles when he saw the merry party,
and soon they were sitting down to a plain, but
well-cooked and substantial meal. And they all
had appetites, too!</p>

<p>&#8220;We will spend the night at the Mansion
House, in Fairport,&#8221; spoke Cora, consulting a list
after dinner. &#8220;I will telephone for rooms.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you had better let me,&#8221; suggested
Cousin Mary, and she made the arrangements
over the wire.</p>

<p>Once more they were under way again, and
all went well until Jack shouted that his tire had
gone flat and would have to be pumped up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go ahead&#8211;don&#8217;t wait for us!&#8221; he called to
his sister. &#8220;We can speed up and catch you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t take the wrong road,&#8221; Cora cautioned,
and then Jack and Ed got out the repair kit. The
work took them longer than they had expected,
and it was getting dusk when they were ready to
proceed.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll never make it before dark, old man,&#8221;
said Ed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I guess we will. I&#8217;m going to fracture
some speed limits,&#8221; and Jack opened wide the
throttle. The <i>Get There</i> did make good time,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span>
but it was not worthy of its name. For, after
going for some time, Jack felt that he must
be nearing Fairport. He got out to look at a sign
post, lighting a match to distinguish the directions.
Then he uttered an expression of dismay.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked Ed, anxiously. &#8220;Something
else gone wrong, Jack?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8211;<i>we&#8217;ve</i> gone wrong!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, we&#8217;re on the Belleville turnpike, and to
my certain knowledge we&#8217;re about fifteen miles
off the right road for Fairport. I thought that
fellow we asked, about sunset, didn&#8217;t seem very
sure of his directions. He told us wrong&#8211;maybe
not on purpose&#8211;but wrong just the same. Ed,
old man, we are lost in a dismal country with night
coming on. Please groan and shiver for me,
while I think of the proper thing to say. We&#8217;re
lost!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, the only thing to do is to go back,&#8221;
remarked Ed, philosophically. &#8220;Come on. Luckily
the roads are good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hark! Some one is coming!&#8221; exclaimed
Jack, as he heard footfalls on the hard highway.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll ask him. Maybe there&#8217;s a short cut to
Fairport.&#8221;</p>

<p>The figure advanced out of the darkness into
the glare of the lights on Jack&#8217;s car. Then he
exclaimed involuntarily:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a girl!&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span><a id='link_7'></a>CHAPTER VII<br /><span class='h2fs'>WORRIES</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Where shall we leave our cars?&#8221; asked Belle.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a garage just around the corner from
the hotel,&#8221; answered Cora. &#8220;We can have the
man look the machines over, too, and see that
there is plenty of gasoline and oil. Then we won&#8217;t
have to worry.&#8221;</p>

<p>The three cars had drawn up in front of the
Mansion House at Fairport, following a pleasant
run after the sheep episode. Jack and Ed, of
course, were not present, and of them more presently.
They were having, as Jack might express
it, &#8220;their own troubles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but I&#8217;m warm and dusty!&#8221; exclaimed
Eline as she &#8220;flopped&#8221; from the car to the sidewalk.
Flopped is the only word that properly
expresses it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;re not much used to motoring,&#8221; remarked
Cora with a smile, as she disengaged herself
from the steering wheel. &#8220;It is tiring, at
first, but one soon becomes used to it. How did
you like it, Cousin Mary?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was delightful, my dear, purely delightful;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>
but I will own that I shall be glad to walk again.&#8221;
She alighted from the car of the twins. The two
sisters got down, and Belle went around to look at
one of the rear tires. She had a suspicion,
amounting to a conviction, that it had gone flat.
It had.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll let the garage man attend to it,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;I&#8217;m too anxious now to get some nice warm
water, soap and a large towel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Me for a large, juicy towel!&#8221; exclaimed Walter,
coming up with Norton. &#8220;Will you have
yours boiled or stewed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Silly! I don&#8217;t call that a joke!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t need to; it comes without calling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s worse,&#8221; declared Bess, trying to get
some of the road dust off her face with a very
small handkerchief.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;re here, anyhow!&#8221; put in Norton,
&#8220;I don&#8217;t think much of the hotel, though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will do very nicely,&#8221; answered Cora somewhat
coldly. She was not quite sure whether she
was going to like Norton or not. He did not
seem to improve upon acquaintance, and she was
a little sorry that Jack had asked him on the trip.
Still, she reflected, one can easily be mistaken about
boys. Perhaps his flippant manner might be due
to nervousness, or a diffidence in not knowing how
to say the right thing at the right time.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re here&#8211;because we&#8217;re here!&#8221; exclaimed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>
Walter. &#8220;That&#8217;s more than can be said for
Jack and Ed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are they in sight?&#8221; asked Cora, looking
down the long straight road&#8211;the main street of
Fairport&#8211;by which they had entered the town.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet,&#8221; answered Bess. &#8220;Oh, do let&#8217;s get
into the hotel!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;A crowd is
collecting, and I do so want a drink of cold
water.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hot tea for me,&#8221; spoke Belle. &#8220;Hot tea
with a slice of lemon in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Since Belle went to that Russian tea-fest last
winter she always takes lemon in her tea,&#8221; explained
her sister. &#8220;Ugh! I can&#8217;t bear it!&#8221;
Bess was nothing if not certain in her likes and
dislikes.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really the only way to drink tea, my
dear,&#8221; said Belle, with an affected society drawl.
&#8220;It&#8217;s so&#8211;so mussy with cream and sugar in it,&#8221;
and she spread out her hands in Ã¦sthetic horror&#8211;or
something to simulate that.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I shall be satisfied with just plain tea,&#8221;
voiced Cora, as she took another look down the
road for her brother. &#8220;Come on, girls&#8211;and
boys!&#8221; she added.</p>

<p>A little throng was beginning to gather in front
of the hotel, somewhat blocking the sidewalk, for
the sight of the cars drawn up in front of the
hostel and perhaps the sight of the four&#8211;well,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>
it might as well be said&#8211;pretty motor girls, had
attracted attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shoo&#8211;shoo&#8211;chickens!&#8221; exclaimed Mrs.
Fordam with a laugh as she brought up back of
the girls. &#8220;Let&#8217;s get in and freshen up for supper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dinner!&#8221; cried Walter. &#8220;It&#8217;s not allowed
to say supper on this tour. Dinner; isn&#8217;t it,
Cora?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As you like,&#8221; she assented a bit wearily, for
now, after the excitement of the day, the work
and worry, much of which had necessarily fallen
to her, Cora was beginning to feel the reaction.
The fire, too, and the strange woman, all had
added to it. But she knew they could have a good
rest that evening.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jack must be having trouble with that tire,&#8221;
she went on, as they entered the hotel. &#8220;I think
he had better put on an entirely new one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he&#8217;ll be here pretty soon,&#8221; said Walter.
&#8220;Really we haven&#8217;t been here long, and we ought
to allow him half an hour anyway. The <i>Get
There</i> will go&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Once it does go,&#8221; interrupted Norton. &#8220;I
wonder where we register?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the desk,&#8221; said Walter, pointing to
where the hotel clerk stood behind the counter
waiting for the party. He smiled a welcome.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll register for the girls,&#8221; said Mrs. Fordam.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>
&#8220;I want to see how the rooms are arranged before
we commit ourselves to them.&#8221;</p>

<p>The suite was satisfactory and soon the girls
had gone to their apartments, their suit cases
having been brought up by the bell boys. Walter
and Norton, after putting their names down on
the register, took the three cars to the garage
around the corner, leaving them there for the
night.</p>

<p>&#8220;Unless we want to take a little spin this evening,&#8221;
suggested Norton, as they were on their way
back to the hotel.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess the girls will be too tired,&#8221; returned
Walter. &#8220;We might take in a show, however.
That would be restful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not any moving pictures!&#8221; exclaimed Norton,
hastily. &#8220;I&#8217;m dead sick of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So am I. There are a couple of good
theatres in town, I think. However, we&#8217;ll leave
it to the girls.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you see anything of Jack?&#8221; asked Cora,
anxiously, as the two young men came in. There
was a worried look in her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, he hasn&#8217;t come yet,&#8221; answered Walter.
&#8220;But it&#8217;s early yet. Dinner won&#8217;t be served for
an hour, the clerk told me. Say, you girls look
all right!&#8221; and there was genuine admiration in
his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t we?&#8221; asked Eline. She had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>
put on a fawn-colored dress that set off her complexion
wonderfully well. Cora had put on her
new brown, while Belle in blue and Bess in mauve
added to the charm. The girls had freshened
their complexion with cold cream and a thorough
rinsing, and all traces of the rather dusty trip
had been removed.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s up to us for our glad rags,&#8221; said Norton.
&#8220;Come on, Walter. There&#8217;s no use letting them
carry off all the honors,&#8221; and he started for the
elevator.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you&#8217;d give just a look, and see if Jack
isn&#8217;t coming,&#8221; went on Cora. &#8220;I&#8217;m really a little
worried. He may have had an accident.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now don&#8217;t you go to worrying,&#8221; counseled
Walter, in his best brotherly manner. &#8220;Jack
and Ed can take care of themselves, all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, don&#8217;t worry,&#8221; went on Mrs. Fordam.
&#8220;It will spoil your pleasure, Cora.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I just can&#8217;t help it. Come on, girls, we&#8217;ll
get our wraps and go outside. I simply can&#8217;t sit
still.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, we had plenty of sitting all day,&#8221; admitted
Bess. &#8220;I believe it would be nice to walk
up and down out in front for a change. It&#8217;s
rather stuffy in here,&#8221; and she glanced about a
typical hotel parlor.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, go ahead and we&#8217;ll be with you in
a little while,&#8221; directed Walter, he and Norton
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>
going to their rooms while the girls and Mrs.
Fordam went outside.</p>

<p>All the injunctions of her companions not to
worry did not drive anxiety from Cora. Time
and again she glanced down the road her brother
must come, but the <i>Get There</i> was not living up to
its name.</p>

<p>Dusk came, but no Jack. The promise of good
appetites for the dinner was not carried out, for
Cora&#8217;s worry affected all of them more or less.
And it began to look as if something really had
happened.</p>

<p>&#8220;I simply must do something!&#8221; Cora exclaimed
after dinner. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to see if I can&#8217;t telephone
to some one along the road, and ask if there
has been an accident.&#8221;</p>

<p>They tried to persuade her not to, but she insisted
and started toward the booth.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span><a id='link_8'></a>CHAPTER VIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE GIRL</span></h2>

<p>Jack and Ed, standing near the machine, under
the sign post, peered at the advancing figure of
the girl. She had stopped short&#8211;stopped rather
timidly, it seemed, and she now stood there silent,
apparently waiting for the boys to say something.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a girl, sure enough,&#8221; said Ed, in a low
voice. &#8220;Out alone, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack, who never hesitated long at doing anything,
resolved to at once plunge into the midst
of this new problem.</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me,&#8221; he said, taking off his cap, and
he knew she could see him, for they were all
in the glare of the auto&#8217;s lamps now, &#8220;excuse me,
but can you tell us if there is any shorter way to
get to Fairport than by going back? We are lost,
it seems.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So&#8211;so am I!&#8221; faltered the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; exclaimed Ed.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is&#8211;well, I&#8217;m not exactly lost,&#8221; and Jack
could see her smile faintly. Yet behind the smile
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>
there seemed to be sorrow, and it was evident,
even in the difficult light of the gas lamps, that
she had been crying.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re lost&#8211;but not exactly lost,&#8221; remarked
Ed, with a laugh. &#8220;That&#8217;s&#8211;er&#8211;rather odd;
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; He was anxious to put the girl at her
ease. Clearly a strange young girl&#8211;and pretty,
too, as the boys could see&#8211;would need to be put
at her ease when alone, after dark, on a country
road.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;I guess it is,&#8221; she admitted, and Jack made
a mental note that he liked her voice. Quite discriminating
in regard to voices Jack was getting&#8211;at
least in his own estimation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you can&#8217;t help us much, I&#8217;m afraid,&#8221;
went on Ed. &#8220;If you&#8217;re a stranger around
here&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I&#8217;m a stranger&#8211;quite a stranger.
I don&#8217;t know a soul!&#8221;</p>

<p>She said it so quickly&#8211;bringing out the words
so promptly after Ed&#8217;s suggestion, that it almost
seemed as though she had caught at a straw
thrown in her way by a chance wind. Why did
she want to make it appear that she was a
stranger? And that she did want to give that
impression&#8211;rightly or wrongly&#8211;was very evident
to both young men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we are both&#8211;I mean all three&#8211;lost,&#8221;
spoke Jack, good-naturedly. &#8220;I guess there&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>
no help for it, Ed. We&#8217;ll have to go back the
way we came until we strike the road to Fairport.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose so. But it will bring us in pretty
late.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No help for it. What is to be&#8211;has to be.
Cora will worry&#8211;she has that habit lately.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Naturally. Well, maybe we can get to a telephone
somewhere, and let them know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You could do that!&#8221; exclaimed the girl, impulsively.
&#8220;I know what it is to worry. I saw
a telephone not more than a mile back. I mean,&#8221;
she explained with a smile, &#8220;I saw a place where
there was a telephone pay station sign. It was
in a little country store, where I stopped to&#8211;to&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>She hesitated and her voice faltered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here!&#8221; exclaimed Jack. &#8220;Perhaps we
can help <i>you</i>! Are you going anywhere that we
can give you a lift? We&#8217;re bound to be late
anyhow, and a little more time won&#8217;t matter.
You see my sister and some friends&#8211;other girls
and boys&#8211;are out on a trip. We are going to
Sandy Point Cove, and are taking it easy on the
way. My machine developed tire trouble a while
ago&#8211;quite a while it is now,&#8221; he said ruefully,
&#8220;and the others went on. I thought I could get
up to them, but I took the wrong road and&#8211;well,
here we are. Now if we can give you a ride, why,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span>
we&#8217;ll be glad to. Ed can sit on the run-board,
and you&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I couldn&#8217;t trouble you!&#8221; the girl exclaimed.
&#8220;I&#8211;I am going&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>She stopped rather abruptly and Jack and Ed
each confessed to the other, later, that they were
mortally afraid she was going to cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;And if she had,&#8221; said Jack, &#8220;I&#8217;d have been
up in the air for fair!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Same here!&#8221; admitted Ed.</p>

<p>But she did not cry. She conquered the inclination,
and went on.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean that I don&#8217;t know exactly where I am
going,&#8221; the girl said. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t important, anyhow.
It doesn&#8217;t much matter where I stop.&#8221;
There was a pathetic, hopeless note in her voice
now.</p>

<p>Again Jack took a sudden resolve.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here!&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a sister,
and Ed here, and I, have a lot of girl friends.
We wouldn&#8217;t want them to be out alone at night
on a country road. So if you&#8217;ll excuse us, I think
it would be better if we could take you to some of
your friends. We won&#8217;t mind in the least, going
out of our way to do it, either.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not!&#8221; put in Ed.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8211;I&#8213;&#8221; she seemed struggling with
some emotion. &#8220;I love to be in the country!&#8221;
she said suddenly&#8211;as though she had made up her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>
mind to rush through some explanation of her
plight &#8220;I take long walks often. I think I
walked too far to-day. I&#8211;I expected to reach
Hayden before dark, but I stayed too long in a
pretty little wood. I&#8211;am going to stop at
the Young Women&#8217;s Christian Association in
Hayden. But that&#8217;s only a mile further, and
I can be there before it&#8217;s very much
darker.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it can get any darker than this, I&#8217;d like to
see it,&#8221; remarked Ed, staring at the blackness
which surrounded them.</p>

<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s only a mile or so farther then we&#8217;re
going to take you there!&#8221; exclaimed Jack.
&#8220;We&#8217;re bound to be late anyhow, and we might
as well be killed for a sheep as a lamb. Ed, it&#8217;s
you for the run-board.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With pleasure,&#8221; and he bowed to the girl.</p>

<p>She laughed&#8211;just the least bit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but I couldn&#8217;t think of troubling you!&#8221;
the girl exclaimed. &#8220;Really, I&#8211;I&#8213;&#8221; She did
not know what to say. Jack saw her clasp her
hands convulsively. He had a good look at her
face. Really she was quite pretty, he decided, an
opinion in which Ed coincided.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here!&#8221; cried Jack, purposely rough.
He had found that tone advisable to take with
Cora sometimes. &#8220;Look here, we are going on
to Hayden anyhow, so you might as well ride
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>
with us as walk. I know my sister, Cora Kimball&#8211;perhaps
you know her&#8213;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe I do,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, no matter&#8211;anyhow, she&#8217;d never forgive
me&#8211;nor Ed either, if we left you like this.
And I know Ed would fuss more about Cora not
forgiving him than I would. So you&#8217;ve just got
to ride,&#8221; and he smiled frankly.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I thought you said you were going to
Fairport,&#8221; spoke the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are,&#8221; answered Jack. &#8220;But I&#8217;m not going
to chase back all those fifteen miles we came
by mistake. It would take too long, especially
after dark. So if we can&#8217;t take a short cut over
from Hayden, we&#8217;ll stay there all night, and go
on in the morning. I can telephone my sister.
I suppose there are &#8217;phones in Hayden.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, it&#8211;it&#8217;s quite a town&#8211;a small city,
I believe,&#8221; said the girl. &#8220;I inquired about it at
the last stop I made, and they told me of the
association where I could stay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then come on!&#8221; invited Jack. &#8220;I&#8217;ll crank
up, and you can ride with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re sure it won&#8217;t be any trouble?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bit&#8211;it will be a pleasure to have you.
But perhaps we ought to look for a nearer telephone,
and send word to your friends,&#8221; Jack
suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;No&#8211;no,&#8221; she spoke rapidly. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>
any&#8211;I mean they won&#8217;t worry about me. I am used
to looking after myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Truly she seemed so, and now she appeared
even more self-reliant as she stood there in the
glare of the lamps of the auto. Her face had
lost some of the traces of hopeless despair, and
she had somehow managed to get rid of the evidences
of the tears. The boys wondered how she
did it, for it was rather like a magician&#8217;s trick,
&#8220;done in full view of the audience.&#8221; Jack and
Ed paid a mental tribute to her accomplishment
in using a handkerchief.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure you are comfortable there?&#8221;
the girl asked Ed, as he crouched partly on the
floor of the car, with his feet on the run-board.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite,&#8221; he affirmed, not altogether truthfully,
but at least gallantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems so selfish of me, that really&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Ed&#8217;s all right!&#8221; cried Jack, gaily.
&#8220;He&#8217;d rather ride on the run-board than anywhere
else; wouldn&#8217;t you, old man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In fact, he often sits there when there&#8217;s a
vacant seat. It&#8217;s a hobby of his. I&#8217;ve tried to
break him of it, but he is hopeless!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I know you&#8217;re poking fun at me!&#8221; she
exclaimed, and she laughed lightly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve almost
a notion&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>She made a motion as though to alight.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you dare!&#8221; cried Jack. &#8220;Here we
go!&#8221; He let in the gear, and the clutch came
into place. The car moved forward slowly, and
gathered speed.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be there in no time,&#8221; Jack went on.
&#8220;It&#8217;s rather unpleasant for you, isn&#8217;t it, going
about by yourself?&#8221; he asked the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m used to it. I have been working in
an office, but I&#8211;I decided on a vacation. I took
it rather suddenly, and I haven&#8217;t made any plans
since. I decided to go off&#8211;and, yes, lose myself
for a time. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m in a part of the
country I have never visited before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; remarked Jack. &#8220;It is sometimes
good to do things on an impulse. I know how
tiresome the dull routine and grind must
be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He never worked a day in his life!&#8221; exclaimed
Ed.</p>

<p>&#8220;No knocking, old man!&#8221; laughed Jack. &#8220;I
think I&#8217;d like to be in an office myself,&#8221; he added.
Mentally he decided that one where this girl was
employed might not be a half-bad place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he&#8217;d want an office where the hours
were from ten to twelve, with an hour for
lunch,&#8221; grunted Ed, as the car went over a bump,
jolting him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I really liked the work,&#8221; said the girl. &#8220;Of
course there were some unpleasant features&#8211;in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>
fact, that is why I left so suddenly. Now I am&#8211;free!&#8221;</p>

<p>She took a long breath of the night air rushing
against her cheeks, as though the idea of
being free was most delightful.</p>

<p>They talked of various subjects as the car shot
along in the darkness. Both Jack and Ed were
quite curious to learn more about this stray girl,
but they had the good sense not to ask leading
questions. Nor did she volunteer much information.</p>

<p>Finally the lights of Hayden glimmered into
view, and soon the car had stopped in front of
the Y. W. C. A., which Jack had located through
a policeman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I shall be all right,&#8221; the girl exclaimed
as Jack helped her out. &#8220;Thank you a thousand
times. I really&#8211;I don&#8217;t know what I should have
done had I not met you. I&#8211;I was just beginning
to&#8211;get afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure you will be all right now?&#8221;
asked Ed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t we do anything more for you?&#8221; Jack
wanted to know. &#8220;I&#8217;m Jack Kimball, of Chelton,
and this is Ed Foster. We are pretty well
known in these parts, though we&#8217;ve never been
in Hayden before. We auto around a good bit.
If we can do anything&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, thank you ever so much. I shall be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>
all right.&#8221; She gave Jack her hand, in a warm
clasp, and then turned to Ed. &#8220;Thank you&#8211;so
much!&#8221; She smiled, showing her white, even
teeth, and ran up the steps of the building&#8211;a
place where a lone girl could always find a safe
shelter. She turned on the top step, waved a
good-bye to them, and disappeared behind the
doors.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you know about that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s rather queer&#8211;all the way along.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack asked and Ed answered. They stood by
the machine and looked up at the building into
which the girl had gone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I guess there&#8217;s nothing for us to do
but to see if there isn&#8217;t some way to get to Fairport
from here,&#8221; remarked Jack, after a pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it&#8211;and telephone. There&#8217;s a drug-store
across the street. It has a &#8217;phone sign.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, then.&#8221;</p>

<p>Presently they had been connected with the
Mansion House, and Cora was at the other end
of the wire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Jack, what happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We got lost&#8211;on the wrong road&#8211;that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Jack, I&#8217;ve been so worried!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pshaw! What was the use? Didn&#8217;t I ever
get lost before?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re too fussy, Sis. How&#8217;s everybody?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right&#8211;but&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>&#8220;But them as is wrong; eh? Well, we&#8217;ll soon
be with you. We had quite an adventure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You did? Were you hurt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, can&#8217;t a fellow have an adventure without
getting hurt? We met a pretty girl, and gave
her a ride&#8211;that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jack! You never did!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, we did. Ed&#8217;s here, and he&#8217;ll tell
you all about it. It was a great time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jack Kimball, I believe you&#8217;re just teasing
me! You&#8217;re not in Hayden at all!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where am I, then?&#8221; he challenged.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right in town, and just as like as not you&#8217;re
calling up from across the street here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m not then. You ask central. We
really were lost on the road, and had quite a
time. I don&#8217;t know now whether we can be
with you to-night or not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Jack, you must!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if we can&#8217;t&#8211;we can&#8217;t. If we can find a
short cut we&#8217;ll take it. Otherwise we&#8217;ll stay here
all night and come on early in the morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that will have to do then,&#8221; said Cora,
with a sigh. &#8220;Oh, but we have been so worried.
Who was that girl, Jack?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does Ed?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span>&#8220;Not guilty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The idea! And you gave her a ride?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not? We met her on the road&#8211;she
was all alone&#8211;it was dark. What else could we
do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so, I suppose. Where is she now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the Y. W. C. A.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s all right then. Listen, you will
try to come on to-night; won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, Sis.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so tired, and it&#8217;s more of a responsibility
than I thought it would be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t worry, Sis. We&#8217;re going to get
something to eat, and then we&#8217;ll see what we
can do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eat! You don&#8217;t mean to say, Jack Kimball,
that you&#8217;re going to stop to <i>eat</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I guess we are. Haven&#8217;t had a bite
since noon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why can&#8217;t you get dinner after you get
here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It might be more like breakfast than dinner
if we waited,&#8221; and Jack laughed. &#8220;No, we&#8217;re
going to eat here and then we&#8217;ll see what we can
do. Don&#8217;t worry any more. The <i>Get There</i> will
go somewhere, anyhow. Now take it easy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. I will, only do try to come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Want to talk to Ed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>&#8220;Oh, only to say &#8216;how de do,&#8217;&#8221; and again
Jack laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly I&#8217;ll speak to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ed on the wire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Cora. It&#8217;s all right. I listened to
what Jack said.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s all&#8211;I mean did you really help a
girl?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who was she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s telling. I&#8217;ve got her name, only Jack
doesn&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you believe him,&#8221; interjected Jack sideways
into the transmitter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Try and make him come on to-night!&#8221; said
Cora. &#8220;Your rooms are all engaged.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will. Are the girls all right?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And your cousin?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Walter making himself useful as he always
does, I suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course. Don&#8217;t be silly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not. I&#8217;m only trying to think of something
else to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t try then!&#8221; and Cora&#8217;s voice had
a tint of snap in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t get mad,&#8221; Ed advised her. &#8220;Give
my love to the girls, and tell &#8217;em we&#8217;ll be with &#8217;em
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>
soon. Do you want to talk to Jack again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, only tell him to please come to-night.
I want to talk to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About that girl, I expect.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe a word about her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha! I&#8217;ll show you a lock of her hair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;d surely know you were fooling. Say,
listen, you will make Jack come; won&#8217;t you, Ed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surest thing you know. Shall I say good-bye?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you can&#8217;t think of anything else to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. See you soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have a sweet telephone toll to pay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to make Jack do it. He&#8217;s asking
the clerk here how to get to Fairport the quickest
way. The clerk&#8217;s another girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m not going to talk another word.
Good-bye,&#8221; and a click in his ear told Ed that
Cora had hung up the receiver. He laughed
and joined Jack, who had gone away from the
booth.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span><a id='link_10'></a>CHAPTER X<br /><span class='h2fs'>REUNITED</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Who was she?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Cora who demanded this when, an hour
or so later, Jack and Ed had been reunited to
their party in the Mansion House at Fairport.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who was she?&#8221; and Cora looked appealingly
at her brother, who smiled in a tantalizing
fashion.</p>

<p>&#8220;We told you everything,&#8221; remarked Ed.
&#8220;Over the wire, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very easy to tell things&#8211;over the wire,&#8221;
remarked Belle, with a laugh. &#8220;One doesn&#8217;t
have to&#8211;blush, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if one does, even the central operator
can&#8217;t see it,&#8221; spoke Bess. &#8220;Oh, you boys have
given us a big scare!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Scare? How?&#8221; demanded Jack, with a
look at his sister. &#8220;We couldn&#8217;t help getting
on the wrong road.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps not, Jack,&#8221; said Mrs. Fordam,
gently. &#8220;But Cora was quite worried, and has
been telephoning to police stations all along the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>
route to see if she could get any word about you
and Ed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you?&#8221; asked Ed, quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was one report of an auto accident,&#8221;
spoke Cora, &#8220;and I was so frightened, Jack, until
I heard that it was a big car, and then I knew
it couldn&#8217;t be yours. But did it all happen as
you&#8217;ve told?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; exclaimed Jack.</p>

<p>&#8220;Girl and all?&#8221; Walter wanted to know.</p>

<p>&#8220;The girl <i>most</i> of all,&#8221; answered Ed. &#8220;How
about it, Jack old man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m with you. She&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; commanded Cora. &#8220;We don&#8217;t
want you to incriminate yourselves any more than
you have to. Besides it&#8217;s getting late, and we
must get some rest to be ready for an early start
to-morrow morning.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I have been quite worried, Jack, and I
couldn&#8217;t get much satisfaction by telephoning.
However, you&#8217;re here now, and we will forgive
you. Did you have supper?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We had&#8211;dinner,&#8221; answered Ed, with a tantalizing
smile. &#8220;It was a good one, too. Then
we got on the right road and made pretty good
time over here.&#8221;</p>

<p>The little party of young people was in the
hotel parlor. As Cora had said, it was getting
late, the hands of the clock approaching the midnight
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>
hour, and they all had had rather a strenuous
time that day.</p>

<p>Jack and Ed had left their car in the garage
with the others.</p>

<p>&#8220;Me for the downy feathers!&#8221; exclaimed
Jack, with a yawn. &#8220;You look sleepy, too,
Eline.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not, even a little bit, really,&#8221; and she
smiled brightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;They keep late hours&#8211;in Chicago,&#8221; remarked
Belle, with a laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;I really think we had better retire,&#8221; said Mrs.
Fordam.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to do&#8211;in the morning,&#8221;
spoke Jack.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not going to stay up until morning,
Jack!&#8221; cried Cora.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, that was only a joke,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;I
mean I&#8217;m going to have a new tire put on the
<i>Get There</i>&#8211;have it re-tired you see. Get the
idea? It was a joke.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A tired one,&#8221; yawned Ed. &#8220;Come on to
bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, if we try to get off any more smart sayings
we&#8217;ll all have the nightmare,&#8221; suggested
Walter.</p>

<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s no fun to make a tour on one of
those creatures instead of in an auto,&#8221; put in
Norton.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>The young travelers were soon on their way
to that part of the hotel set aside for them. Mrs.
Fordam had seen to it that the girls got the most
comfortable rooms. The boys were not so particular.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll try and get started by nine o&#8217;clock,&#8221;
suggested Cora, as she bade her brother good-night.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s too early,&#8221; he protested. &#8220;Why,
we&#8217;d have to get up and have breakfast at seven.
Make it ten, Sis, and that will give me time to
have that tire looked after. Otherwise I may
be holding you back all along the route.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; Cora assented. &#8220;We&#8217;ll make it
ten.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, old man, who was she?&#8221; asked Walter,
as he and Jack strolled along the corridor together.
&#8220;Tell a fellow; can&#8217;t you? I won&#8217;t
give you away if you were stringing the
girls.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t stringing them!&#8221; declared Jack.
&#8220;It all happened just as I&#8217;ve said.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But who was she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A mystery of the road,&#8221; put in Ed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pretty?&#8221; Norton wanted to know, quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pretty&#8211;pretty,&#8221; echoed Jack. &#8220;Really all
she told us was that she had been working in an
office, had become tired of it and was traveling
about as a sort of vacation.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span>&#8220;Did she look as though that might be the
case?&#8221; asked Walter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eminently so, my august cross-questioner,&#8221;
answered Jack. &#8220;And that&#8217;s all I&#8217;m going to
say. I&#8217;m dead tired. See you later,&#8221; and he
went to his room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who do you suppose that girl could have
been?&#8221; asked Bess of Cora a little later, as they
were putting up their hair for the night.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t the least idea.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, how queer. I thought you did have!&#8221;
and Bess looked at Cora in rather a searching
manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Why should I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I haven&#8217;t any special reason for saying
so, and yet&#8211;oh, well, it doesn&#8217;t make any difference
I suppose, but&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bess Robinson, just what do you mean?&#8221;
and Cora&#8217;s eyes lost their slumberous inclination
as she faced her chum.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Cora dear, nothing at all,&#8221; and Bess
spoke very sweetly. &#8220;Only, from the way you
spoke to Jack, and the way he answered, I fancied&#8211;oh,
really it&#8217;s nothing at all. I shouldn&#8217;t have
said it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like those half-formed questions, Bess.
If you think anything&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, really I&#8217;m too tired to think, Cora. I&#8217;m
going to bed.&#8221; They had adjoining rooms.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span>&#8220;Perhaps you have some theory yourself?&#8221;
suggested Cora.</p>

<p>&#8220;None in the least. I don&#8217;t even know what
a theory is. Is it that algebra affair?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Cora, with a laugh. &#8220;You
are hopeless, Bess. Good-night!&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack and the other boys were up early, despite
the former&#8217;s objection to a too-soon breakfast.
They ate before the girls had come down, and
then went around to the garage to see about the
cars, Jack to get a new tire for his, while Norton
wanted the ignition system of his engine gone
over.</p>

<p>It was when these attentions had been given
that Norton, with a twinkle in his eyes, exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Fellows, I&#8217;ve thought of a joke!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; demanded Jack.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush! Listen, as the telephone girl says.
Pray thee come hither,&#8221; and he led the three to a
corner of the garage. Then ensued some whispering.</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s that?&#8221; demanded Norton, when he
had concluded. &#8220;Won&#8217;t it be rich? The girls
won&#8217;t know what is up, for we can get Bess and
Belle into the car, without them seeing the rear
of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a good trick all right,&#8221; admitted Jack
rather slowly, &#8220;I only hope they won&#8217;t get angry
about it.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>&#8220;Angry!&#8221; cried Norton. &#8220;How could they
be? According to your story they&#8217;ve done worse
than that to you fellows lots of times.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure they have,&#8221; declared Ed. &#8220;Go ahead
and do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have my doubts,&#8221; spoke Walter, deliberately,
&#8220;but I&#8217;m not going to be the kill-joy. Go
ahead, I&#8217;ll do my share,&#8221; but he was not very enthusiastic.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can get the cloth and paint here,&#8221; went
on Norton. &#8220;I&#8217;ll do the lettering. You can
make the pudding, Jack.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. But who&#8217;s to get in the car with
Belle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; exclaimed Norton, quickly. &#8220;You
fellows can make some excuse. I&#8217;ll let Walter
drive my car, and Bess can ride with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; assented Jack. &#8220;It&#8217;s a go,&#8221; and
they proceeded to carry out their little joke, over
the outcome of which Walter and Jack, at least,
had some anxiety.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span><a id='link_11'></a>CHAPTER XI<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE GIRLS RETALIATE</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;But why should we change our plans?&#8221;
asked Cora, when, a little later, the boys had
brought their own cars up in front of the hotels
and had gone back for those of the girls. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t see why Bess should ride with Walter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but I see it,&#8221; said Walter, quickly. &#8220;I
want to talk to her, and&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s a different story,&#8221; admitted Cora,
with a smile. &#8220;But what will Norton do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to drive the <i>Flyaway</i>, if I might,&#8221;
put in the latter. &#8220;There&#8217;s a bad stretch of
road ahead, and perhaps Belle may not be equal
to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you dare intimate there&#8217;s danger
ahead,&#8221; cried Belle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not exactly danger,&#8221; returned Norton, with
a wink at the other boys, &#8220;but the road is rough.
If Cora wants to I guess Ed could drive her car
for her, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, I&#8217;ll wait until I see what sort of
a road we are going to encounter, and if I can&#8217;t
negotiate it, I&#8217;ll let Ed take the wheel,&#8221; assented
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>
Cora. &#8220;But I&#8217;ve driven over some very hard
stretches myself; haven&#8217;t I, Jack?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed you have, Sis. But it&#8217;s all right if
Belle wants Norton to drive for her for a
change.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; began the Robinson twin, &#8220;it all
came so suddenly. I don&#8217;t know yet whether I
want Norton to drive for me. Of course I&#8217;d
like to have him in the car, if Bess wants to go
with Walter for a change, and&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it,&#8221; broke in Norton. &#8220;Just for a
change. Hurry up now, girls, get in the cars
and we&#8217;ll be off.&#8221; He ran here and there, helping
lift in the luggage, and appeared anxious to make
a start. In fact, the boys had seemed in a hurry
ever since they brought up the girls&#8217; cars, and
this very haste might have made the motor maids
suspicious, but it did not seem to.</p>

<p>Then came the proposal for the change in companionship
for a time, and this took the attention
of Cora and her friends. Jack had run his car
close up to the rear of the <i>Flyaway</i>, so that the
back of the tonneau was not easily seen.</p>

<p>&#8220;All aboard!&#8221; cried Ed. &#8220;We&#8217;re off!&#8221;</p>

<p>Quite a little throng had gathered on the sidewalk
in front to see the start, and among the persons
might have been noticed a certain number
of boys, with paper bags concealed in their hands.
These same boys might have been observed to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>
receiving signals&#8211;in the way of nods and winks
from Jack and his chums, from time to time.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure those boys are up to something!&#8221;
exclaimed Cora to Eline, as they took their
places.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean some trick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can you tell?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Jack&#8217;s so anxious to get us off. He
paid the hotel bill for me, bought me a magazine
and some candy. He never does things like
that unless there is something queer about to happen.
Does anything seem wrong? Do I look
all right?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perfectly charming, Cora. That&#8217;s a stunning
sweater you have.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I like it. Then it can&#8217;t be me that he&#8217;s
going to bother. I wish I could tell what it was.&#8221;
She looked back to where Jack, with hurried politeness,
was helping Belle into her car. He did
not want her to have a glimpse at the rear of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll see what develops,&#8221; spoke Cora,
as she slipped in first speed, and prepared to set
the clutch. She gave a last look back. The little
cavalcade of autos was all ready to start.
That of Norton, with Walter at the wheel, and
Bess on the seat beside him, was directly behind
Cora&#8217;s big maroon beauty, then came the machine
of the twins and lastly that of Jack.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span>&#8220;Let her go!&#8221; shouted Jack.</p>

<p>Cora&#8217;s machine shot forward. Norton&#8217;s
jumped as Walter let in the clutch. Then Jack,
with a quick motion, pulled from the back of
the Robinson car, that Norton was driving, a
strip of white muslin. It left revealed another,
containing the words:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>ON THEIR HONEYMOON</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Let &#8217;em have it!&#8221; cried Jack.</p>

<p>Instantly the urchins with the paper bags
opened them and a shower of rice fell over Norton
and Belle, being scattered liberally over Mrs.
Fordam.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mercy!&#8221; cried the chaperone. &#8220;What is
this? Stop it at once!&#8221; she ordered to the boys,
but laughingly they persisted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good luck!&#8221; cried the street lads.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurray!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Send us a piece of wedding cake!&#8221;</p>

<p>Cora, turning, seeing the showers of rice and
hearing the calls, guessed what had happened.</p>

<p>&#8220;This was Jack&#8217;s trick!&#8221; she exclaimed.
&#8220;He&#8217;s given the impression that this is a big wedding
party. Oh, wait until I get a chance to retaliate.
Hurry up!&#8221; she cried back to Norton,
who was grinning cheerfully, and trying to summon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span>
a blush to his cheeks to make him fit the part
of the bashful bridegroom.</p>

<p>Walter shot Norton&#8217;s car ahead, and Norton
guided that containing the placard out into the
middle of the street. There the words were
more plainly seen, and good-natured laughter
came from the throng, who thought they understood
the situation. The rice continued to fall,
for the boys had bought liberally of it, and had
bribed the street urchins to throw it.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is terrible!&#8221; exclaimed Bess, in the car
with Walter, seeing what had happened.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only a joke,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But I was afraid
you girls wouldn&#8217;t like it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like it? I should say not. I&#8217;m going to
take that sign off our car at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>She made a motion as though to alight from
the moving auto, but Walter detained her.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll take it off when we get around the corner,&#8221;
he promised.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does this mean?&#8221; demanded Belle,
rather indignantly, of Norton.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess they take this for a wedding procession,&#8221;
he replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;And who are&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>She stopped suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see!&#8221; she exclaimed, as the meaning of the
rice came to her. &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t think this a
bit nice. I&#8217;d rather have my sister back here
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>
with me,&#8221; she went on coldly. &#8220;Mrs. Fordam,
is there anything on our car&#8211;any of those silly
white satin ribbons, or&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Old shoes?&#8221; suggested Norton, rather
abashed at the way his joke had been received.</p>

<p>The chaperone looked over the rear of the
tonneau.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a strip of cloth on here, with some
letters on it,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;but I can&#8217;t read it
upside down without my glasses. Surely&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>She hesitated for a moment, and then cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;The rice! Oh, I see! Boys, you shouldn&#8217;t
have done it!&#8221; but she laughed nevertheless, and
Norton felt more relieved.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was only in fun,&#8221; he protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;A boy&#8217;s idea of fun, and a girl&#8217;s, often differ
exceedingly,&#8221; spoke Mrs. Fordam. &#8220;I really
think it had better be taken off.&#8221;</p>

<p>The crowd had been following along the sidewalk,
tossing rice and showering congratulations
on those in the &#8220;bridal-car.&#8221; Norton saw that
Mrs. Fordam meant what she said. So he
stopped the machine and got out to remove the
placard, just as Cora was about to turn around
to learn more of the cause of the merriment.
Norton ripped off the lettered muslin and tossed
it aside.</p>

<p>&#8220;It may do for someone else to play a joke
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span>
with,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;I guess I got myself in
bad here. I&#8217;ll have to make up for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There, you needn&#8217;t get out&#8211;Norton is fixing
it,&#8221; said Bess to Walter. &#8220;But I think I&#8217;ll ride
in my own car, if you don&#8217;t mind,&#8221; and she prepared
to get out as he put on the brakes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not mad; are you?&#8221; he asked, and there was
a note of anxiety in his voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not exactly,&#8221; she replied with a smile.</p>

<p>Cora, who had made the turn, and had learned
what had happened, said nothing. She looked at
Jack rather reprovingly, however. Then, the
crowd seeing no more chance for fun, began to
drop back. The autos went on, the twins in
their own, and Walter back with Norton, while
Jack and Ed rode together, Cora being with
Eline up ahead&#8211;a pacemaker.</p>

<p>There was a little coldness among the girls
and boys&#8211;on the side of the girls&#8211;when they
stopped for dinner at a country hotel. Nothing
of moment had occurred on the road, save that
Cora got a puncture, and Jack and the other
boys had no little difficulty in getting off an old
shoe that had not been removed in some
time.</p>

<p>A little later something went wrong with the
carbureter on the car of the twins. The boys
took turns trying to adjust it, as they were far
from a garage. It was Norton who discovered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>
the trouble&#8211;a simple enough matter&#8211;and remedied
it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t that entitle me to a rebate of punishment?&#8221;
he asked of Belle.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see,&#8221; she answered, but her glance was
not as stern as it had been, and she ventured to
smile a little.</p>

<p>With the offending placard removed, the cars
proceeded onward again. They had planned to
take the trip leisurely, and to stop over night
at another hotel. The day following that would
bring them to Sandy Point Cove in good time to
settle the bungalows before dark.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to the theatre to-night,&#8221; Jack
announced, shortly after the arrival in Duncan,
where they were to spend the night. He had
gone out after reaching the hotel, and purchased
the seats for a popular comedy then running.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, are we?&#8221; asked Cora with a lifting of
her eyebrows, a signal, that had Jack but known
it, meant more than he suspected. &#8220;That&#8217;s awfully
nice of you, really.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a fine show,&#8221; declared Norton. &#8220;A
friend of mine saw it in New York.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What time are we to be ready?&#8221; asked Belle,
with a look at Cora.</p>

<p>&#8220;It begins at eight, if you start now putting
on your hats you&#8217;ll be ready in time, it&#8217;s only
a little after six,&#8221; remarked Ed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span>&#8220;Smart!&#8221; exclaimed Bess. &#8220;We can be
ready as soon as you!&#8221;</p>

<p>After supper&#8211;or dinner whichever you prefer
to call it&#8211;the boys went to their rooms to get
ready for the little theatre party. The girls,
with much whispering and not a little laughter
proceeded, apparently, with the same object.</p>

<p>But a little later the motor maids, accompanied
by their chaperone, Mrs. Fordam, slipped down
a rear stairway, out into the ladies&#8217; parlor of the
hotel, and thence into two big limousine cars that
awaited them. The girls had on semi-evening
dress, with some flimsy chiffon veils over their
heads in place of hats, which might account for
the speed with which they got ready.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it nice we met those boys!&#8221; exclaimed
Eline.</p>

<p>&#8220;They came just in time to make it possible
for us to retaliate,&#8221; remarked Cora. &#8220;And our
boys need a lesson.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the somewhat luxurious autos that had
drawn up in front of the hotel were four young
men in evening dress. They greeted the girls enthusiastically.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s awfully nice of you to come on such
short notice,&#8221; said one to Cora.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we were only too glad to&#8221; she answered.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span><a id='link_12'></a>CHAPTER XII<br /><span class='h2fs'>AT THE COVE</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Well, what do you know about that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8211;well, so long as there are none of &#8217;em
here I&#8217;ll say it&#8211;it&#8217;s the limit!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They got back at us all right!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And to think we never suspected.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What will we do with these theatre tickets?&#8221;</p>

<p>Four young men, in freshened attire after their
auto ride, stood disconsolately in the hotel parlor.
Jack was fingering a note that a bell boy had
brought him. Walter, Ed and Norton, with the
assistance of Jack, had given voice to the expressions
with which we have begun this chapter.
The note read:</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear Jack:</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t seem to care about the
theatre this evening. I met Harry Dunn, and
his two cousins&#8211;also another young man&#8211;Ralph
Borden&#8211;and they asked us to go to a
little private dance. Mrs. Fordam is with us.
We met Harry at Lake Como last year, you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>
remember. He is that tall, dark, distinguished-looking
fellow. So we thought we&#8217;d prefer the
dance to the theatre, especially as Belle and Bess
have seen the play. Sorry to have to waste so
many good tickets, but perhaps you boys will have
time to paint another honeymoon sign.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cora.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was this note which had been handed to Jack
as he and his companions had been waiting in the
parlor for the girls, that had caused all the
trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;So, that&#8217;s their game!&#8221; exclaimed Cora&#8217;s
brother, as he crumpled the paper up in his hand.
&#8220;They&#8217;ve played a trick on us all right!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To get back at us for that sign on the auto,
and the rice,&#8221; added Ed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if they really did go off to a
dance?&#8221; asked Walter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I know this Dunn chap&#8211;not
half-bad,&#8221; put in Jack. &#8220;Sis and I did meet him last
year. His folks have a country place somewhere
round here. But how did he meet the girls and
get them to come?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have it!&#8221; cried Norton.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pass it over!&#8221; commanded Walter.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know that time my car developed a
kink,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;and you stopped yours,
Jack?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; assented Cora&#8217;s brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, the girls went on, you know, and when
we caught up to them I saw a couple of autos
speeding down the road, as though they had been
acting as escorts. I guess those fellows must
have met the girls on the road, proposed the
dance, and the girls accepted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it!&#8221; declared Jack. And so it proved,
as they found out later.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s no help for it,&#8221; sighed Walter.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to go to the show alone,&#8221; added
Ed.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we could only find some nice girls,&#8221; spoke
Norton.</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t know a soul in town,&#8221; declared
Jack. &#8220;If that Dunn fellow had been half-way
decent he&#8217;d have made some arrangement about
us after he stole away the girls. Well, there&#8217;s
no use wasting all the tickets. Come on to the
show.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the boys went, but they did not have a very
good time by themselves, and there was some
amusement among the audience over four good-looking
boys occupying eight seats.</p>

<p>As for Cora and the girls, they had a delightful
dance. It had turned out as Norton had said.
The girls, proceeding on ahead with Mrs. Fordam,
after Jack and the boys had stopped to look
after Norton&#8217;s car, had met young Dunn and his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span>
companions out for a spin. Cora knew them at
once, and the young men, delighted at the prospect
of such charming partners at a dance they
had almost elected to forgo, invited the motor
girls to it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fordam, who was a distant relative of
young Dunn&#8217;s father, had consented to the arrangement.
The girls and she slipped away after
Jack came in with the theatre tickets, proceeded
to attire themselves most becomingly, and
had been met by their escorts, who lavishly hired
big cars to take their friends to the affair. Then
Jack and his chums had been handed the note
which Cora left for them. It had all been very
simple.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t it glorious!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The floor was just splendid!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And those boys knew so many nice fellows.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My card was filled almost before I knew it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The music was lovely!&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus chattered the motor girls as they came
back to the hotel rather late&#8211;or was it early?
with Mrs. Fordam. They saw Jack sitting disconsolately
in the parlor, trying hard to keep
awake by reading.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, so you&#8217;re back!&#8221; he exclaimed to Cora,
rather shortly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, brother mine!&#8221; she laughed tantalizingly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s about time,&#8221; he growled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, how long have you been back?&#8221; she
asked. &#8220;I hear that it was quite a long and&#8211;tiresome&#8211;show.
I&#8217;m sorry we had to disappoint
you, but really we had no other way of telling
you where we were going. It was a lovely
dance!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Jack, coldly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And we hope you had time to embroider another
sign for our car,&#8221; added Bess. Really, she
said later, she could not help it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Um!&#8221; grunted Jack. &#8220;I sat up for you,&#8221;
he added to his sister.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was no need, Jack. We had Mrs.
Fordam. It was a very pretty dance. I am glad
the girls had a chance to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girls seemed glad too, and really looked
quite effective in their party growns, which were
carried in the trunks that were strapped on the
autos.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it was lovely!&#8221; sighed Bess.</p>

<p>&#8220;And that tall young fellow was such a fine
dancer!&#8221; echoed Eline.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; growled Jack. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess we&#8217;re all tired enough to re-tire&#8211;joke!&#8221;
exclaimed Cora. &#8220;Good-night, Jack.
Sorry we couldn&#8217;t go with you, but we had a&#8211;previous
engagement!&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys did not say much next morning,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>
though the girls were enthusiastic about their affair.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we could only have one two or three times
a week,&#8221; sighed Belle, who was a fine dancer.</p>

<p>&#8220;We may, at Sandy Point Cove,&#8221; spoke Cora.
&#8220;There is a pavilion there&#8211;also moving picture
shows, to which the boys can take us,&#8221; and she
glanced at Jack. He said nothing.</p>

<p>Once more they were on their way. The
roads were good, and save for the fact that they
took a wrong one shortly after lunch, and went
a few miles out of their route, nothing of moment
happened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ten miles to Sandy Point Cove!&#8221; read
Jack, as they stopped at a cross-road, to inspect
the signboards. &#8220;We&#8217;ll make it in an
hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And then for a bath in the briny deep!&#8221; cried
Walter.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope the fishing is good,&#8221; remarked Ed.
&#8220;I haven&#8217;t caught anything in a month.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope the <i>Pet</i> has arrived,&#8221; Cora exclaimed.
&#8220;I am just dying for a motor boat ride.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us hope it has then; we don&#8217;t want you
to expire,&#8221; came from Norton.</p>

<p>In less than an hour they had reached the shore
road and were spinning down it toward the cove
where they were to spend the summer. As they
mounted the bluff, around the end of the cove,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>
from which a magnificent view of the ocean could
be had, Cora uttered a cry:</p>

<p>&#8220;Look, that sailboat has capsized!&#8221; she exclaimed.
And she pointed to a small sloop that
had jibed and gone over in a sudden squall. As
the motor girls and boys looked they saw a girlish
form clinging to the rounded side of the craft,
her bright red bathing suit making her a conspicuous
figure against the dark hull.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span><a id='link_13'></a>CHAPTER XIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE LIGHTHOUSE MAID</span></h2>

<p>Jack Kimball had always said that his sister
Cora only needed an opportunity to prove that
she could think quickly in emergencies, and could
demonstrate that she was courageous. Cora had
done this on other occasions, and now at the sight
of the overturned boat, and the figure of the girl
clinging to it, there came the chance for Cora,
as one of the motor girls, to prove that her
ability in this direction had not lessened.</p>

<p>Without another word Cora turned her car
down a slight slope that led to the sandy beach.
It was a perilous road, rather too steep to negotiate
in a heavy car, but Cora had seen that it
was encumbered with sand that would act as a
brake.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; gasped Eline, gripping
the sides of the seat until her hands ached.</p>

<p>&#8220;Down to rescue that girl!&#8221; explained Cora,
pressing her lips tightly together. She was under
a nervous tension, and she needed all her wits
about her.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>&#8220;But in the car&#8211;the water&#8213;&#8221; faltered
Eline.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry. I&#8217;m not going to run my car
into the bay. There&#8217;s a boat on shore&#8211;a rowboat&#8211;this
was the quickest way to get down to
it. Can you row?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Cora, but&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may have to!&#8221;</p>

<p>The auto plunged down the steep, sandy slope
to the beach. The others in the motoring party
had brought their machines to a stop, and were
gazing in wonderment at Cora.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do?&#8221; cried Jack.
&#8220;Come back! We&#8217;ll get her, Cora!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Cora paid no attention. She had reached
the beach, and quickly shut off the power.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on!&#8221; she exclaimed to Eline, leaping
out.</p>

<p>The two raced over the sand to where a light
rowing craft was drawn up. There were oars in
it, and Cora knew she and Eline could launch
it. The girl on the overturned sailboat was making
frantic gestures and calling:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurry! Hurry!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Her boat must be sinking,&#8221; gasped Eline, as
she and Cora reached the rowboat.</p>

<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t be that,&#8221; answered the motormaid,
with a quick and critical glance at the sailboat.
&#8220;Probably there is some one else with her, who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>
is in danger. She isn&#8217;t in any particular trouble
that I can see. She must swim!&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time Cora and Eline had the boat in
the water. The stern was still on the pebbly
beach.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jump in!&#8221; called Cora. &#8220;I&#8217;ll shove off!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;ll get your feet wet!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What of it? As if I cared!&#8221; Vigorously
Cora pushed off the boat, and managed to get in,
though not without getting rather wet. Then,
seizing one pair of oars, while Eline took the
others, they rowed hastily out to the capsized
craft. Other boats were now hastening to the
scene of the accident, but Cora Kimball was the
first to reach it. Jack and the other boys and
girls had left their cars on the main road, and
were racing down the beach.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m so glad you came!&#8221; gasped the girl
on the sail boat. &#8220;I&#8217;m holding him, but I can&#8217;t
seem to pull him up here. He&#8217;s so heavy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is it?&#8221; gasped Cora. She was rather
out of breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;My little brother Dick. He got in the way
of the boom, and the main sheet fouled. That&#8217;s
why I jibed. I&#8217;d never have done it by myself.
We both went overboard, and I grabbed him. I
got up here, but I can&#8217;t pull him up. Oh, please
help me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I will,&#8221; cried Cora.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>&#8220;Then pull around on the other side, and you
can lift him into your boat. I can swim ashore.&#8221;</p>

<p>Directed by the girl on the sail boat, Cora and
Eline sent their craft around so that they were
opposite the half-submerged deck, which was now
perpendicular in the water. There they saw the
girl holding above the surface of the bay the
head of a boy about seven years old. He seemed
as self-possessed as though he were on shore, and
calmly blinked at the rescuing girls.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s so fat and heavy,&#8221; cried the girl in the
bathing suit.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very fat,&#8221; confessed the boy in the water,
calmly.</p>

<p>Indeed he did seem so, even though only his
head and part of his shoulders showed. The
wind was rising a little again, having subsided
somewhat after capsizing the boat. The surface
of the bay was broken into little waves, and they
splashed into the face of the fat boy. But he did
not seem to mind.</p>

<p>It was easier than Cora and Eline had thought
it would be to get him in the boat, for the buoyancy
of the salt water aided them, as did the
rather large bulk of the boy himself, it being a
well known fact that stout persons float much
more easily in the water than do thin ones.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give yourself a boost, Dick!&#8221; directed the
girl in the bathing suit, to her brother. He did
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>
so with a grunt that would have been laughable
under other circumstances, and soon he was safe
in the other boat, very wet, but otherwise not
hurt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you swallow much water?&#8221; asked Cora,
anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nope,&#8221; was the sententious answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess he&#8217;ll be all right,&#8221; remarked his sister.
&#8220;If you will kindly row him over there, I&#8217;ll swim
in,&#8221; and she pointed to the lighthouse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you live there?&#8221; asked Cora, gazing at
the tall stone tower. With its high lantern,
which glistened in the sun, it stood on a point
extending out into the bay, just behind some menacing
rocks that jutted far out into the water in
a dangerous reef that the light warned mariners
against.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Dick and I live there,&#8221; answered the
girl. &#8220;My father, James Haley, is keeper of
the light. My name is Rosalie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you look it,&#8221; said Cora, brightly, as she
noted the damask cheeks of the bathing girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, thank you!&#8221; came quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you get in this boat&#8211;I don&#8217;t know
whose it is&#8211;I just appropriated it,&#8221; said Cora.
&#8220;There is no need of your swimming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I want to. I&#8217;ve gone clear across the
bay, though Daddy had a boat follow me. I&#8217;ve
won prizes swimming. No, I&#8217;ll just swim over.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span>&#8220;Will your brother be all right with us?&#8221;
and Cora looked at the small dripping figure in
the boat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, Dick is as good as gold. He&#8217;ll do
just as you tell him. I guess he was rather scared
when he went over. But he can swim, only I
was rather afraid to let him try this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What about your boat?&#8221; asked Eline.</p>

<p>&#8220;She will stay here. The anchor fell out when
she went over, so she won&#8217;t drift. I&#8217;ll get one
of the men to tow her ashore and right her.
She&#8217;s a good little old tub. She&#8217;s capsized before.&#8221;</p>

<p>With that the lighthouse maid made a graceful
dive and was soon swimming alongside Cora&#8217;s
boat. The latter and Eline now rowed to the
lighthouse, the girl in the water following, and
the autoists on shore breathing more freely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t that splendid of Cora!&#8221; cried Belle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just fine!&#8221; declared Bess.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sis was right on the mark!&#8221; exclaimed Jack,
with pardonable pride. &#8220;I wonder who that girl
in the red suit is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s some swimmer; believe me!&#8221; declared
Norton in admiration.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is that,&#8221; agreed Walter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, it&#8217;s going to be no joke to get Cora&#8217;s
car up that hill of sand,&#8221; declared Ed, glancing
back to it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>&#8220;We can pull her up with ropes if we have to,&#8221;
said Jack. &#8220;I wonder where our bungles are,
anyhow? Notice that &#8216;bungles&#8217;&#8211;patent applied
for!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fancy those over there,&#8221; remarked Mrs.
Fordam, pointing to two that stood somewhat
removed from a group of cottages. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; the
chaperone went on, &#8220;I can see Aunt Susan in
the door of one waving to us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Me for Aunt Susan, then!&#8221; cried Jack. &#8220;I
hope she has something to eat!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eat!&#8221; gasped Belle. &#8220;Do you boys think
that Aunt Susan is going to cook for you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, wasn&#8217;t that the arrangement?&#8221; inquired
Jack, blankly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed not!&#8221; was the quick answer. &#8220;You
boys are to do your own providing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we can do it!&#8221; spoke Walter, quickly.
&#8220;And, mind, don&#8217;t ask us for some of our pie
and cake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry,&#8221; remarked Bess, with a shrug
of her shoulders.</p>

<p>The little accident in the bay had not attracted
much attention. Several who had run down to
the water&#8217;s edge, now that they saw the two rescued,
strolled away again, while the boats that
had started toward the capsized one veered off
as the occupants saw the one containing Cora
move away, and noted the girl swimming.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>Of course Cora and Eline could have reached
the lighthouse much quicker than Rosalie Haley
had they desired, but Cora was a bit diffident
about rowing up to meet a strange man with his
rescued son, leaving the daughter swimming out
in the bay.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll just keep with her,&#8221; whispered Cora
to Eline, nodding toward the swimmer, &#8220;and let
her do the explaining.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed Eline.</p>

<p>They rowed on for a time in silence, the recently
submerged boy saying nothing. Then
Cora called to Rosalie:</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t your father be worried?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe so. He knows both of us can
swim.&#8221; She talked easily in the water for she
progressed with her head well out, being, in fact,
an excellent swimmer. &#8220;Besides,&#8221; she went on,
as she reached forward in her side stroke, &#8220;poor
Daddy has other things to worry about. His
sister has disappeared&#8211;our Aunt Margaret.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Disappeared!&#8221; echoed Cora.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, gone completely. And not under the
most pleasant circumstances, either; but Daddy
believes that it&#8217;s all a mistake and will be cleared
up some day. But he is certainly worried about
Aunt Margaret, and he&#8217;s had the authorities looking
all over, but they can&#8217;t find her. So that&#8217;s
why I know he won&#8217;t worry over a little thing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span>
like this. He&#8217;s got a bigger one,&#8221; and she swam
on.</p>

<p>Cora wondered where she had heard that name&#8211;Margaret&#8211;before. She was sure she had,
and under peculiar circumstances, but so much had
been crowded into the last few minutes that her
brain did not act quickly. It was a puzzle that
she reserved for future solution.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span><a id='link_14'></a>CHAPTER XIV<br /><span class='h2fs'>SETTLING DOWN</span></h2>

<p>When Cora, leading by the hand dripping
Dick Haley, met his father, the keeper of the
light, she exclaimed impulsively:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ve seen you somewhere before!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was rather a strange greeting under the
circumstances, considering that Cora had just
helped little Dick from the water. But the lighthouse
keeper did not seem to mind it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I can&#8217;t remember it, miss,&#8221; he made
answer, &#8220;and I&#8217;m counted on as having a pretty
good memory. However, the loss is all mine, I
do assure you. Now what mischief has my fat
boy been getting into?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was not his fault, I&#8217;m sure,&#8221; spoke Eline.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed not,&#8221; echoed Cora. &#8220;Your daughter&#8217;s
boat upset and we went out to help her.
There she is!&#8221;</p>

<p>Cora pointed to a dripping figure, in a red
bathing suit climbing up on a little pier that led
to the beacon. Following the disclosure made to
Cora, as Rosalie swam beside the boat, they had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>
reached the shore. Mr. Haley had been off getting
some supplies for the lighthouse and so had
not witnessed the accident. The first intimation
he had of it was when he saw his dripping son
being led up by Cora and Eline.</p>

<p>&#8220;Upset; eh?&#8221; voiced the keeper of the light.
&#8220;Well, it has happened before, and it&#8217;ll happen
again. I&#8217;m glad it was no worse, and I&#8217;m very
much obliged to you, miss. But I don&#8217;t ever remember
seeing you before&#8211;either of you,&#8221; and
he glanced at Eline.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m sure you never saw <i>me</i>!&#8221; she
laughed &#8220;I&#8217;m from Chicago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Chicago!&#8221; he cried, quickly. &#8220;Why, I&#8217;m
from there originally. I used to be a pilot on
the lakes. But that&#8217;s years ago. Me and my
sister came from there. But Margaret&#8211;well,
what&#8217;s the use of talking of it?&#8221; and the worried
frown on his face deepened, as he went down to
meet his daughter, telling Dick to go up in the
living quarters of the light to get on dry clothes.</p>

<p>Cora was sure she had seen the light keeper
before, but, puzzle her brain over the matter as
she might, she could not recall where it was.
And the name Margaret seemed to be impressed
on her memory, too. It was quite annoying not
to be able to recall matters when you wanted to,
she thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;ll just think no more about it,&#8221; mused

Cora. &#8220;Perhaps it will come to me when I
least expect it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lighthouse maid and her father met, and
in a few words she told of the accident. He sent
a man to tow in the overturned boat.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you are wet, too!&#8221; he exclaimed to Cora,
as he noted her damp skirts and soaked shoes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s nothing!&#8221; said she. &#8220;I pushed
off the boat. I don&#8217;t know whose it is, by the
way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It belongs to Hank Belton,&#8221; said the keeper.
&#8220;He won&#8217;t mind you using it. Do you live
around here?&#8221;</p>

<p>Cora told how they were coming to the bungalows
for the summer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, then I&#8217;ll see you again, miss,&#8221; spoke Mr.
Haley. &#8220;I can&#8217;t properly thank you now&#8211;I&#8217;m
that flustered. This has upset me a little, though
usually I don&#8217;t worry about the children and the
water, for they look after themselves. But I&#8217;m
fair bothered about other matters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I told her, Daddy,&#8221; broke in Rosalie.
&#8220;About Aunt Margaret, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you? Well, I dare say it was all right.
I can&#8217;t see why she did it? I can&#8217;t see! Going
off that way, without notice, and those people to
make such unkind insinuations. I can&#8217;t understand
it!&#8221;</p>

<p>He walked up and down in front of the little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>
dock. Rosalie looked as though she would enjoy
another plunge in the bay. Cora glanced
over to where her friends awaited her in a group
on the beach. Eline was looking at dripping
Dick going up to get on dry garments.</p>

<p>&#8220;But there!&#8221; exclaimed Mr. Haley, &#8220;I
mustn&#8217;t bother you with my troubles. I dare
say you have enough of your own. But do come
over and see us; won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, do!&#8221; urged Rosalie.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will,&#8221; said Cora. &#8220;But now I must get
back to my friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You had best take the boat and row over,&#8221;
said the light keeper. &#8220;It&#8217;s shorter that way.
You can leave her just where you found her.
Hank won&#8217;t mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll row you over,&#8221; offered Rosalie.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed, thank you, we can do it,&#8221; spoke
Cora. &#8220;We are anxious to get settled in our
bungalows, so I think we had better go now.
We will see you again,&#8221; and with a smile and a
nod, she and Eline went down to the boat, which
had been left at the lighthouse float, and got in.
A little later they were with their friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Cora, you certainly did something that
time!&#8221; remarked Jack.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you didn&#8217;t lose any time,&#8221; added Ed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Weren&#8217;t you frightened?&#8221; Belle wanted to
know.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>&#8220;Not a bit&#8211;not even I,&#8221; answered Eline,
&#8220;and I don&#8217;t know much about the water.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who was she? What happened? How did
you get the boy out? Who keeps the light?
Tell us all about it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Cora held up her hands to ward off the avalanche
of questions, and told as much as was
necessary. She did not mention having spoken
about thinking she had met the keeper of the
light before, nor about the insistence of the name
Margaret. Nor did it enter into Eline&#8217;s brief
added description of the events of that strenuously-filled
half-hour.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, here comes Aunt Susan,&#8221; remarked
Mrs. Fordam. &#8220;I think she couldn&#8217;t wait any
longer to learn all about what happened, and I
don&#8217;t blame her. I&#8217;ll soon turn you girls over to
her charge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but you&#8217;ll stay with us to-night!&#8221; exclaimed
Cora.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and I&#8217;ll go back home in the morning
on the train. Really I have enjoyed this trip
very much, and I would like to stay longer, but
I can&#8217;t. Perhaps I may come down during the
summer to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please do,&#8221; invited Cora.</p>

<p>Aunt Susan proved worthy of her name, a
home-like lady, with an easy manner, that made
one feel comfortable at once. She simply
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>
&#8220;oozed&#8221; good things to eat, as Jack said, and
Jack ought to know. Some of the young people
she knew, having met them at Cora&#8217;s house.
The others were presented to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, the bungalows are all ready for you,&#8221;
she went on, after explanations had been made.
&#8220;I expect you&#8217;re tired and hungry and&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wet,&#8221; interrupted Jack, with a look at Cora.
&#8220;But then you can&#8217;t make rescues from the briny
deep without getting at least damp.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like to change,&#8221; spoke Cora, glancing
at her soaked shoes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then come on,&#8221; said Aunt Susan. &#8220;I guess
you boys know where your quarters are,&#8221; she
added. &#8220;There is plenty to eat&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurray!&#8221; cried Jack, swinging his hat, and
clapping Walter on the shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you&#8217;ll all have supper together,&#8221;
suggested Mrs. Chester.</p>

<p>&#8220;If the girls let us,&#8221; added Ed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I guess we will,&#8221; assented Cora. &#8220;That
is, if you get my car up. I didn&#8217;t think, when I
ran it down, that the sand was so deep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll look after it&#8211;don&#8217;t worry, Sis,&#8221; said
Jack.</p>

<p>While the girls and the two ladies went on to
the larger bungalow, the boys managed, not without
some work, to get Cora&#8217;s auto up to the
road again. Then it was run along, with the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span>
others, to the big bungalow, where there was a
shed that would serve as shelter for the machines.</p>

<p>The boys carried in the girls&#8217; trunks and suit
cases, and transported their own to their quarters.
Then began a general &#8220;primping&#8221; time, as the
supper hour approached.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, girls, isn&#8217;t this just delightful?&#8221; exclaimed
Cora, as she and the others entered what
was to be their home for the summer.</p>

<p>&#8220;That window seat is a dear!&#8221; declared Belle,
as she proceeded to &#8220;drape&#8221; herself in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;And see the porch hammocks,&#8221; called Bess,
&#8220;slumping&#8221; into one.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a fine view of the bay we can get from
here,&#8221; added Eline, as she stood in the bow window,
a most graceful figure. Cora, in spite of
her damp shoes, had made a hurried trip through
the bungalow to arrange, tentatively at least, as
hostess, the different sleeping apartments.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s just the dearest place!&#8221; exclaimed
Eline. &#8220;I know we will simply love it here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now just put off your things, get comfortable,
wash and comb if you like, and then the
boys will be over to supper,&#8221; said Mrs. Chester,
when the girls had made a tour of the place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gracious! Here they come now!&#8221; cried
Belle, as she saw Jack and his friends tramping
over the space that separated the two bungalows.</p>

<p>The girls fled precipitately, for they had begun
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>
to lay aside their collars and loosen their hair.
Then the two ladies took charge of matters, in
the kitchen at least. The boys were bidden to
remain out on the piazzas until invited in, and
they sprawled in various attitudes in chairs or
hammocks.</p>

<p>Then the girls came down; there was noticed
throughout the bungalow various savory odors,
at which the boys grinned in delight. There was
the clatter of plates, and the jingle of silver&#8211;more
expansive smiles. There were looks of
pleased anticipation. Then came the clanging of
a bell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Supper!&#8221; announced Mrs. Chester, appearing
in the door wearing a huge apron.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s us!&#8221; cried Jack.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve just thought of it!&#8221; exclaimed Cora
in a low voice to Eline, as she walked beside her
to the dining room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thought of what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The name &#8216;Margaret!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pass the olives again, please!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t the lobsters delicious?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you referring to us?&#8221; Ed bristled up,
and looked rather aggressively at Belle.</p>

<p>&#8220;If the net fits&#8213;&#8221; she murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;Net being the sea-change from shoe,&#8221; spoke
Jack.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please pass the olives,&#8221; came again from
Bess, waiting patiently. &#8220;I&#8217;ve only had&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A dozen!&#8221; interrupted Ed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Children!&#8221; rebuked Cora.</p>

<p>They were all at the supper table&#8211;I prefer,
since we are now at sea, which makes so many
equal&#8211;to call the late meal supper, in preference
to dinner. No fisherman ever eats a &#8220;dinner&#8221;
except at noon, and it was now well on to
six o&#8217;clock. And they were making merry, were
the motor maids and boys.</p>

<p>Mrs. Chester had made bountiful provision
for the party and they were now enjoying it thoroughly.
Over in the bungalow of the boys were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span>
ample supplies for days to come, though such
as would not keep had been laid in sparingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You girls certainly look nice enough to&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eat, were you going to say?&#8221; asked Eline,
who was particularly &#8220;fetching,&#8221; to quote Norton,
whereupon Jack wanted to know what it
was she was expected to &#8220;fetch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, at least nibble at,&#8221; remarked Walter.
&#8220;Some of you don&#8217;t look as though you would
stand more than a nibble,&#8221; and he looked particularly
at Bess.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but there is so much to do,&#8221; sighed Cora,
as she thought of the arrangements for the night.
&#8220;We really must hurry through supper and
straighten things out. Then we can rest to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t take you long to straighten out,&#8221;
said Ed, with a jovial smile. &#8220;One minute you&#8217;re
rescuing fat boys from the salty ocean, and the
next you look as charming as&#8211;er&#8211;as&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As a mermaid,&#8221; finished Walter.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you do it?&#8221; Norton wanted to
know. &#8220;This is the first long motor trip I&#8217;ve
taken, and I&#8217;m wearing the collar of your brother,
with the necktie of Ed. I can&#8217;t seem to find a
thing of my own.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is all done by system,&#8221; said Cora.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hear! Hear!&#8221; cried Jack, English fashion.
&#8220;Sis will kindly elucidate the system.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>&#8220;Finish your supper!&#8221; ordered Cora. &#8220;We
want you boys to help carry around some of our
trunks. We&#8217;re going to place them differently.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;More work,&#8221; groaned Ed.</p>

<p>But the meal was finally over and the boys put
the trunks in the rooms of the various girls.
Mrs. Chester had engaged the wife of one of the
Cove fishermen to come in to help with the house-work,
so the two chaperones could leave the
dishes to her while they helped the girls settle
their apartments. The bungalow was of ample
size, and they were sure to be comfortable.</p>

<p>The boys did some &#8220;straightening-out,&#8221; but it
was more honored in the breach than in the observance.
When they wanted a thing they
&#8220;pawed&#8221; over their suit cases until they found
it, letting the other articles settle where they
might.</p>

<p>They were all out on the porch, talking and
laughing over the events of the day, Cora being
called upon to recount her experiences in making
the rescue.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cora,&#8221; spoke Eline softly, when some of the
motor boys and girls had voted for a stroll down
to the beach, &#8220;what was it you meant when you
said you recalled the name Margaret?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. I&#8217;m glad you spoke of that. Do
you remember the name of the woman I found
in the garage the night of the fire?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span>&#8220;Mrs.&#8211;Mrs.&#8213;&#8221; Eline paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Margaret Raymond,&#8221; supplied Cora.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that was it. What of her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, the light keeper has a sister who is
missing. Her name is Margaret, too. She is
the aunt of the girl in the red bathing suit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does anything follow from that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose I told you that as soon as I saw Mr.
Haley, the keeper of the light, I was sure I had
seen his face before?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; Eline was quick to grasp at a suggestion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I have never seen him before,&#8221;
went on Cora. &#8220;But his sister must bear
some resemblance to him; don&#8217;t you think,
Eline?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say so&#8211;yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then take the name Margaret&#8211;the fact that
his sister is named that&#8211;also that the strange
woman who ran away from the office, and whom
I found in our garage, was named the same&#8211;the
fact that Mr. Haley&#8217;s sister is strangely missing,
and under some sort of a cloud&#8211;which
would also cover Mrs. Raymond&#8211;and you see
the coincidences; don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed I do!&#8221; declared Eline. &#8220;Oh, Cora,
if it should turn out that they are the same person!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be remarkable. But even if it were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>
so we could not help him. We could give him
no clue as to his sister&#8217;s whereabouts now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we must find out what his sister&#8217;s last
name is. He has invited us over there, and I
think I can speak to him on the subject. It is
worth trying, anyhow. Suppose we go and join
the others.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall you tell them?&#8221; asked Eline.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>They found the rest of the party down on the
shore of the cove. The moon was up and the
picture presented was an attractive one. Two
points, jutting out into the ocean, came near
enough together to make a sort of strait that led
into the bay.</p>

<p>Opening out of the big bay was a smaller
cove&#8211;called Sandy&#8211;from the fine extent of bathing
beach it afforded. It was just back of this
beach that several cottages had been put up,
also the two bungalows occupied by our
friends.</p>

<p>The point on which the lighthouse was built
was somewhat in the shape of a shoe, and on the
farthermost extremity were black rocks, extending,
as I have said, out in a dangerous reef from
which the flashing light warned vessels. The
point was built up with fishermen&#8217;s cottages, or
modest houses, and around the bay was located
the village of Sandy Point, a small settlement,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>
but one that was gradually growing as the summer
colonists found out its beauty.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope the <i>Petrel</i> is here, all right,&#8221; remarked
Jack, when they had talked of many other matters.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to see the first thing in the morning,&#8221;
declared Ed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I am anxious to get her afloat,&#8221; spoke
Cora. &#8220;The water is lovely around here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you ought to know,&#8221; came from Walter,
&#8220;you were out on it to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have some fun bathing,&#8221; said Norton.
&#8220;You say that lighthouse girl has won swimming
prizes, Cora?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe we can get up some races,&#8221; came
from Bess. &#8220;Do you swim, Eline?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some. That&#8217;s what everyone says, I believe.&#8221;</p>

<p>They talked and strolled, and strolled and
talked, until the lateness of the hour sent them
to their bungalows.</p>

<p>There was some little excitement about getting
settled for the night, for it developed that one
of the trunks containing some garments of the
girls had not arrived. But they &#8220;doubled up,&#8221;
and were fairly comfortable. As for the boys,
the sounds of merriment came from their quarters
even at a late hour.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad I don&#8217;t have to chaperone them,&#8221;
remarked Aunt Susan.</p>

<p>Morning came, as it generally does. Jack and
his chums got their own breakfast&#8211;in a more or
less haphazard fashion&#8211;and then set off to the
railroad depot to see about the motor boat.</p>

<p>It was safe in the freight office, and was eagerly
inspected by the boys. For, while Cora and her
motor girl chums really owned the dainty little
craft, the young men felt that they had almost
a proprietary interest in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;How are we going to get it over to the
Cove?&#8221; asked Ed.</p>

<p>&#8220;On a truck, of course,&#8221; replied Jack. &#8220;Then
we&#8217;ll knock off the cradle&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rocked in the cradle of the deep!&#8221; burst
out Walter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s your permit to sing?&#8221; demanded
Jack. &#8220;Stop it. Your swan song will come in
handy when we launch the <i>Pet</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I guess this part of the work is strictly
up to us,&#8221; remarked Norton, as he surveyed the
boat. &#8220;And the sooner we get her into the water
the sooner we can have a ride.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right&#8211;oh!&#8221; exclaimed Jack. &#8220;I&#8217;ll ask the
freight agent about a truck.&#8221;</p>

<p>That official told the boys where they could
hire one, a certain man at the Cove making a
specialty of moving boats.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>A little later the boys were perched on a big
wagon, containing the boat, and moving toward
a boat-repair dock whence most of the launchings
were made.</p>

<p>The girls had word of the little ceremony that
was to occur, and they gathered at the place while
the boys, with the help of one or two men, arranged
to slide the un-cradled boat into the water.</p>

<p>All went well until toward the end. Then the
boat seemed to stick on the rollers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shove her hard!&#8221; cried Jack. &#8220;You fellows
aren&#8217;t putting half enough beef into your
shoves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All together now, boys!&#8221; cried Walter.
&#8220;Here she goes!&#8221;</p>

<p>Just how it happened no one knew, but the <i>Pet</i>
suddenly shot down the ways, sliding over the
rollers. Jack, who had hold of her amidships,
kept his grip, and, as if not wanting to part
company from the youth, or as if objecting to taking
the plunge alone, the motor boat shot into
deep water, carrying Jack with her. He clung
to the gunwhale and shouted&#8211;not in alarm, for
he could swim, but in startled surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold her, Jack, hold her!&#8221; shouted Walter.
&#8220;Or she&#8217;ll smash into that other boat,&#8221; for the
<i>Pet</i>, under the momentum of the slide, was going
stern foremost straight toward an anchored
sloop.</p>

<p>The girls screamed. The boys looked on in
startled amazement. The men who had been
hired to help launch the boat stood with their
hands hanging at their sides, as if unable to do
anything. Finally Walter galvanized himself
into action long enough to exclaim:</p>

<p>&#8220;We should have had a rope fast to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That you had, my lad!&#8221; agreed a grizzled
old fisherman. &#8220;A rope and a kedge anchor
on shore. Howsomever&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t something be done?&#8221; demanded Cora,
clasping her hands impulsively. &#8220;It must be!
Our boat!&#8221;</p>

<p>The spectacle of the fine craft, in which so
many of the hopes and expectations of the young
people centered, about to be damaged, seemed to
send a chill of apprehension to the hearts of the
girls&#8211;more so than in the case of the boys. And
it certainly looked as though a collision was unavoidable.</p>

<p>&#8220;And Jack!&#8221; cried Belle. &#8220;He&#8217;ll be
smashed!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>&#8220;Not on that end,&#8221; remarked Ed, grimly. &#8220;If
he sticks there he won&#8217;t be hurt. He&#8217;s as far
away from the smashing-point as he can
get.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was true, for Jack was now clinging to
the stem of the boat, having edged his way along
from amidships. He did not seem worried, and
in fact was preparing to do the only thing possible
to prevent a collision.</p>

<p>While the boys&#8211;Ed, Walter and Norton&#8211;were
racing about, looking for an available boat
to launch, regardless of the fact that it would be
too late for all practical purposes, and while the
fishermen helpers were disputing as to whose
fault it was that a retaining rope had not been
provided, Jack was carrying out his plan of action.</p>

<p>This was nothing more or less than to turn
himself into a rudder. As a usual thing the rudder
is on the stern of the boat&#8211;necessarily so&#8211;but
in this case the stern of the <i>Pet</i> was the bow,
as far as motion was concerned, and Jack, clinging
to the stem, was on the stern, so to speak.
So, vigorously churning with his feet, as a swimmer
might tread water, he threw himself to one
side, as a rudder might have been turned.</p>

<p>The effect was immediate. The <i>Pet</i> veered to
one side, and the startled owner of the sloop,
toward which the motor boat was plunging, had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>
small use for the hook he had caught up in his
excitement.</p>

<p>In another moment the <i>Pet</i> shot alongside the
other craft, sliding rather violently along the rub-streak,
and careening the sloop and herself as
well. But no real harm was done save the removal
of considerable paint and varnish. Jack
had succeeded in his design.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what were you trying to do?&#8221; demanded
the owner of the sloop, rather angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Trying to save your boat from harm,&#8221; answered
Jack quickly. &#8220;Throw me a line, will
you? and I&#8217;ll come aboard. I don&#8217;t want to get
in the motor boat, all wet as I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure thing!&#8221; the man exclaimed. &#8220;That
was a neat trick you worked. Mighty clever!&#8221;</p>

<p>He flung Jack a rope&#8217;s end, the two boats now
having drifted apart. Jack pulled himself to the
deck of the sloop, letting go his hold on the <i>Pet</i>,
but Walter and Ed were now coming out to get
her in a small boat. Soon she was tied safely
at the float, and Jack returned to shore.</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8211;how did it all happen?&#8221; asked Eline.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Jack, rather pantingly, for his
breath was somewhat spent, &#8220;I had an idea that
I gave a fairly good imitation, a la the moving
picture performance, of how it happened. But
if you&#8217;d prefer to have me play a return engagement,
I might&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you dare!&#8221; cried Cora, as Jack made
a motion as though to plunge into the water again.
&#8220;Was that man very mad, Jack?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, only so-so. Say, I am some wet!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you&#8217;d better go up to the bung, and
change,&#8221; suggested Ed&#8211;&#8220;bung,&#8221; I may explain,
being a short cut for bungalow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess I&#8217;d better,&#8221; agreed the damp one.
&#8220;Say, but she&#8217;s leaking some!&#8221; and he looked
into the cockpit of the motor craft.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will stop when the seams swell,&#8221; was Walter&#8217;s
opinion. &#8220;Come on, fellows, we&#8217;ll look
over the engine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and please get some gasoline,&#8221; suggested
Cora. &#8220;We may be able to go for a
spin this afternoon. Come on, girls. Now that
the <i>Pet</i> is in her element we&#8217;ll take a stroll
around, and look at&#8211;well, at whatever there is
to look at,&#8221; she concluded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go over to the lighthouse,&#8221; suggested
Belle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not now!&#8221; exclaimed Cora, quickly. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
go some other time. Come on,&#8221; and leaving the
boys to go over the intricacies of the motor boat,
the girls strolled along the sand.</p>

<p>Jack hurried on the bungalow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you want to go to the lighthouse?&#8221;
asked Eline of Cora, as they walked on,
arm in arm. &#8220;I think they are so romantic.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>
And perhaps that mermaid&#8217;s father might show
us through it in return for our rescue.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Doubtless he would, and probably he will&#8211;later,&#8221;
said Cora. &#8220;But, Eline, I want to do
some thinking first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About what that mermaid, as you call her,
told me of her father&#8217;s worries. She&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here she comes now,&#8221; interrupted Belle,
catching part of what Cora and Eline were saying.
Walking along the strand, with the chubby
little boy who had been pulled from the water,
was Rosalie.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you do?&#8221; she called pleasantly to
Cora. &#8220;Are you all settled? I think it must
be lovely to live as you girls do, going about as
you please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I think it must be so romantic to live
in a lighthouse,&#8221; interposed Belle. &#8220;Do you
ever tend the light?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Once in a while, when father is busy&#8211;that is,
early in the evening. Father and the assistant,
Harry Small, stand the night watches.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you ever have storms here?&#8221; asked Bess.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, often, yes; and bad ones too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And are ships wrecked?&#8221; Eline queried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Occasionally.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did your light ever save any?&#8221; asked Cora.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, it must have, for the light can be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span>
seen for a long distance. Of course, we can&#8217;t
say how many vessels have come in too close
to the black rocks, and have veered off. But I
know once or twice father has seen the lights
too close in, and then, as the sailors saw the lantern
flash, they would steer out. So you see they
were warned in time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s splendid!&#8221; cried Bess. &#8220;Think of
saving a whole shipload of people!&#8221; and her
eyes sparkled.</p>

<p>&#8220;How is your father?&#8221; asked Cora in a low
voice, as she got a chance to walk with Rosalie,
the other three girls going on ahead.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he is still worried&#8211;if that is what you
mean,&#8221; was the answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is what I do mean, my dear,&#8221; Cora went
on. &#8220;I wonder if you would mind describing
your aunt to us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean the one who&#8211;disappeared?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a challenge, and Rosalie looked curiously
at Cora.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, my dear, I fancy&#8211;no, I will say nothing
until I learn more. But don&#8217;t tell me about
her unless you choose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t mind. Perhaps you
would like to speak to father?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Possibly&#8211;a little later. But was your aunt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>
a delicate woman, with iron gray hair, and rather
a nervous manner?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s Aunt Margaret! But why do
you ask?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will tell you later, my dear. Please don&#8217;t
say anything about it until I see your father.
Do you suppose he would show us through the
light?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course! I&#8217;ll ask him; and that will give
you the chance you want!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine!&#8221; exclaimed Cora. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you
will think this is rather a conspiracy,&#8221; she went
on, &#8220;but I have my reasons. It may amount to
nothing, but I will not be satisfied until I have
proved or disproved something I have suspected
since I came here.&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span><a id='link_17'></a>CHAPTER XVII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE LIGHT KEEPER&#8217;S STORY</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Hurray! She&#8217;s going!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Jack who cried this.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;She starts, she moves, she seems to
feel&#8213;&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As though we&#8217;d catch a wiggling eel!&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus Ed began the quotation, and thus Walter
ended it. The boys had been working in the
motor boat, and had only now, after several
hours, succeeded in getting it to respond to their
labors. The motor started with a sound that
&#8220;meant business,&#8221; as Jack expressed it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go for a run,&#8221; suggested Norton.</p>

<p>&#8220;Better wait for the girls&#8211;it&#8217;s their boat,&#8221;
returned Walter.</p>

<p>&#8220;And we&#8217;d better pump some of the water out
of her,&#8221; added Jack. &#8220;She leaks like a sieve.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pump her out, and by the time the girls are
here she&#8217;ll be ready,&#8221; spoke Walter.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was that carbureter all the while,&#8221; declared
Ed. &#8220;I knew it was!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was sure it was in the secondary coil,&#8221; came
from Jack.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>&#8220;And you couldn&#8217;t make me believe but what
it was one of the spark plugs,&#8221; was Norton&#8217;s contribution.
&#8220;But it was the carbureter, all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All wrong, you mean,&#8221; half grumbled Walter,
whose hands were covered with grease and
gasoline. &#8220;Some one had opened the needle
valve too far.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, let&#8217;s get busy with the pump,&#8221; Jack
said. &#8220;It&#8217;s too nice to be hanging around the
float.&#8221;</p>

<p>The <i>Pet</i> was soon in as good condition as hasty
work could make her, and on the arrival of the
girls the whole party went out for a spin, though
they were a bit crowded. Cora was at the wheel,
a position her right to which none disputed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know these waters around here,&#8221; she
admitted, &#8220;but Rosalie said there was a good
depth nearly all over the Cove, even at low tide.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rosalie being the mermaid?&#8221; asked Norton.
&#8220;I should like to meet her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have asked her over to the bungalow,&#8221;
went on Cora. &#8220;But I warn you that she is a
very <i>sensible</i> girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Meaning that I am not?&#8221; challenged Norton.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a girl&#8211;certainly,&#8221; observed Jack.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not sensible!&#8221; exclaimed Norton.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t give them an opening, boy,&#8221; cautioned
Ed. &#8220;You don&#8217;t know these girls as I do.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t flatter yourself,&#8221; was the contribution
from Bess.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you talk?&#8221; asked Jack of Belle.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s too interested in how deep the water
is, and wondering if she will float as well as dripping
Dick,&#8221; mocked Eline.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not!&#8221; promptly answered Belle. &#8220;And
just to show you that I&#8217;m not afraid I&#8217;m
going to try to swim as soon as we go in bathing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which will be to-morrow,&#8221; said Cora.</p>

<p>They motored about the bay, winding in and
out among anchored and moving craft. Cora
was as adept at the wheel of the <i>Pet</i> as she was
at that of the <i>Whirlwind</i>, and many admiring
comments were made by other steersmen in the
Cove, though Cora knew it not.</p>

<p>&#8220;She stood her land journey well,&#8221; remarked
Bess, as she noted how well the engine was running.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you should have seen the trouble we
had,&#8221; complained Walter. &#8220;We thought she&#8217;d
never go!&#8221;</p>

<p>The day was lovely, and it was a temptation
to stay out, but Cora was wise enough not to remain
too long on the water. Already the effect
of the hot sun was evident on the hands and faces
of all, and the girls were secretly wishing for
some talcum powder.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>They went back to the float, arrangements having
been made to dock the <i>Petrel</i> there. Then
came a hasty meal and another spin.</p>

<p>They were getting matters down to a system
in the bungalows now&#8211;at least the girls were.
The boys lived haphazard, as they always did,
and perhaps always would. Mrs. Chester&#8211;Aunt
Susan&#8211;in the absence of Mrs. Fordam,
who had returned home&#8211;assumed charge of
Cora and her friends to the extent of seeing that
meals were ready on time.</p>

<p>It was their third day at the coast, the time
having been well occupied&#8211;every hour of it almost&#8211;and
the girls were out alone in the <i>Pet</i>&#8211;the
boys having gone fishing&#8211;when Cora observed
a figure in a red bathing suit near the lighthouse
float waving to them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rosalie&#8211;the mermaid!&#8221; exclaimed Bess.
&#8220;What can she want?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps her little brother is in the water
again,&#8221; said Belle.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, she doesn&#8217;t seem excited enough for
that,&#8221; spoke Eline.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll go see,&#8221; was Cora&#8217;s decision.</p>

<p>The <i>Pet</i> circled up to the float and came to a
stop at its side, not a jar marring the landing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well done!&#8221; said Rosalie to Cora. &#8220;There
are not many girls who can run a motor boat
like that.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>&#8220;I have had some practice,&#8221; was the modest
reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father will be glad to see you,&#8221; went on the
mermaid, with a smile. &#8220;He has just been
polishing the light, and I know he&#8217;ll be glad to
show you through.&#8221;</p>

<p>She glanced meaningly at Cora, who returned
the look.</p>

<p>&#8220;Welcome, ladies!&#8221; greeted Mr. Haley.
&#8220;I&#8217;m real glad to see you. Visitors are always
welcome. Are you good climbers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; asked Eline.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because we have no elevator, and it&#8217;s quite a
step to the top of the tower.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we can do it,&#8221; Cora declared.</p>

<p>They were shown through the light, and the
keeper explained how, by means of clock-work,
propelled by heavy weights, the great lens was
revolved, making the flashing light. It turned
every five seconds, sending out a signal that all
the mariners knew, each lighthouse being in a
different class, and the signals they gave, either
fixed or stationary, being calculated to distinguish
different parts of the coast where danger lies.</p>

<p>On their return to the neat parlor, on the appearance
of which the girls complimented Rosalie,
who kept house for her father&#8211;his wife being
dead&#8211;Cora saw a photograph lying on the centre
table. At the sight of it she exclaimed:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>&#8220;That is she!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who? What do you mean?&#8221; cried Mr.
Haley. &#8220;That is my sister!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And it is the woman who was in our barn!&#8221;
Cora said. &#8220;I have thought all along it was.
Now I am sure of it. Mr. Haley, I am sure
I do not want to pry into your family affairs, but
your daughter said something about her aunt being
missing, and how worried you were. I am
sure we have met her since&#8211;since her trouble.
Perhaps we can help you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, if you only could!&#8221; exclaimed the light
keeper. &#8220;My poor sister! Where can she
be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose you tell me a little about her, and
then I&#8211;and my friends&#8211;can decide whether the
woman we met is the one pictured there,&#8221; and
Cora passed the photograph to Bess.</p>

<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t much to tell,&#8221; said the keeper of
the light, slowly. &#8220;My sister is a widow. After
her husband died she went to Westport to
work in an office. She had been a clerk before
her marriage. Everything seemed to go well
for a time and she occasionally wrote to me how
much she liked it. A friend of hers was in the
same building.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then my sister&#8217;s letters ceased suddenly. I
got worried and wrote to her friend. I got an
answer, saying there had been a robbery in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>
office where my sister worked, and that my sister
had disappeared. A young girl left at the same
time, and there was some doubt about the robbery,
though two men were mentioned as being
concerned in it. But my poor sister must have
felt that they would suspect her&#8211;and she never
would take a pin belonging to anyone else. But
she went away, and I&#8217;ve tried all means to locate
her, but I can&#8217;t. It has me worried to
death, nearly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was your sister&#8217;s name?&#8221; asked Cora.</p>

<p>&#8220;Margaret Raymond.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is the same woman!&#8221; spoke Cora,
firmly. &#8220;Oh, to think we didn&#8217;t ask her more
about herself!&#8221;</p>

<p>By degrees she and the other girls told the
story of the woman in the burning barn. They
did not so much as hint of their first suspicions
about the fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what was the name of the girl who
worked in the office with her?&#8221; asked Belle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nancy Ford,&#8221; answered Mr. Haley.</p>

<p>&#8220;There can be no doubt of it,&#8221; declared Cora.
&#8220;That settles it. What a coincidence! That
we should find her brother here!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, can you tell me where my sister is?&#8221;
asked the light keeper.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very sorry, but she went away in a hurry
from my house,&#8221; said Cora, &#8220;and we have not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>
seen her since. We feel sure she was the woman
the sheep herder met that same night,&#8221; and she
told about that incident.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bless that kind man&#8211;he helped her some,
anyhow, and bless you girls,&#8221; said Mr. Haley,
fervently. His eyes were moist, and those of the
girls were not altogether dry.</p>

<p>&#8220;How can we trace her?&#8221; asked Bess.</p>

<p>&#8220;The only way I see,&#8221; spoke Cora, &#8220;is to
write to the town toward which she went after
the sheep man saw her. The authorities there
might give some information.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it!&#8221; cried the light keeper, as he made
a note of the place. &#8220;I can&#8217;t thank you enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we have done scarcely anything,&#8221; answered
Cora. &#8220;We wish it were much more.&#8221;</p>

<p>Further details and forgotten incidents were
mentioned as bearing on the case, and then the
girls departed in the boat. It was a little rough
going back, and the spray flew over them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it strange?&#8221; observed Belle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very queer how it all turned out,&#8221; agreed
Eline.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor woman,&#8221; said Cora. &#8220;I feel so sorry
for her!&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys remained out fishing nearly all day,
and when they returned, not having had exceptional
luck, Cora took Jack to one side and
asked:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span>&#8220;What was the name of the girl you and Ed
met on the road the time of our break-down?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She didn&#8217;t say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, Sis. If I knew I&#8217;d have sent her
a souvenir postal. What&#8217;s the answer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, nothing, I thought perhaps she had mentioned
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nary a word. Did you have a nice ride?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, we went to the lighthouse. And, Jack,
what do you think? That woman&#8211;the one in
our garage&#8211;is Mr. Haley&#8217;s sister!&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack was properly astonished, and he and the
other boys listened with interest to the story of
the identification.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; drawled Norton, &#8220;if we find Nancy
Ford and Mrs. Raymond we&#8217;ll be doing a good
thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If,&#8221; observed Ed, significantly.</p>

<p>The tide was just right. In their newest bathing
suits the motor girls had assembled on the
beach in the hot sun. Their white arms and
necks showed the winter of indoors, but their
faces had already taken on the tan of the seaside.
Soon arms and necks would be in accord.</p>

<p>The boys were out on the float, splashing
about, occasionally &#8220;shooting the chutes&#8221; and
diving from the pier.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is the water cold?&#8221; asked Cora, going down
to where the waves splashed on the pebbles.
Daintily she dipped in&#8211;just a toe. &#8220;How is it,
Jack?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack was tumbling about near the beach like
a porpoise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sw&#8211;swell!&#8221; he managed to gasp, the hesitancy
being because a wave insisted on looking
at his tongue, or trying to scrub his already white
teeth&#8211;Cora could not decide which.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it really warm?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It feels cold.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>&#8220;I know. That&#8217;s because you stand there and
stick one toe in. Get wet all over and&#8211;you&#8217;ll
feel&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack was suddenly plunged under water by
Walter, who had come swimming up, so the sentence
was not finished. But Cora could guess it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going in; come on, girls!&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, wait a little,&#8221; pleaded Belle.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you said you were going to learn to
swim to-day!&#8221; challenged Eline. She looked
particularly well in her dainty bathing costume.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8211;I didn&#8217;t know the water would be
so deep!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Deep!&#8221; echoed Cora. &#8220;It&#8217;s getting shallower
all the while. The tide is going out. Come
on.&#8221;</p>

<p>She waded out a short distance, bravely repressing
the spasmodic screams that sprang to
her lips, and turning to the others said:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8211;it&#8217;s&#8211;fi&#8211;fine&#8211;co&#8211;come on&#8211;in!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen to her!&#8221; cried Bess. &#8220;It must be
like a refrigerator to make her stammer like
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not,&#8221; said Cora. &#8220;It&#8211;it&#8217;s real&#8211;real
warm&#8211;when you&#8211;you&#8211;get used to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have heard said,&#8221; remarked Eline with
studied calmness, &#8220;that one can get used to anything&#8211;if
one only makes up one&#8217;s mind to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come&#8211;come on&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>Cora did not finish. A wave splashed up on
her, taking her breath. Then, resolving to get
it over with, she strode out, threw herself under
water and a moment later was swimming beside
Jack.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cora&#8217;s in!&#8221; exclaimed Bess. &#8220;I&#8217;m going
too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So am I,&#8221; added Eline. &#8220;Come on, Belle!&#8221;</p>

<p>Belle hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can only swim a few strokes,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;I learned at Lake Dunkirk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s much easier in salt water than fresh,&#8221;
insisted Eline, taking hold of Belle&#8217;s arm. &#8220;Do
try!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hesitatingly Belle waded out into the water.
She gasped and choked as the chill struck through
her, then, resolving to be brave, she plunged herself
under. She gasped more than ever, but did
not give up.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are doing fine!&#8221; cried Eline, as she
struck out toward the float.</p>

<p>Suddenly Belle screamed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going down?&#8221; asked Eline in alarm,
yet they were not out beyond their depth.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, she&#8217;s going up!&#8221; asserted Walter, who
was swimming near by.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t make fun of her!&#8221; commanded Cora.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not. She&#8217;s making fun of herself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again Belle screamed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>&#8220;Oh! Oh!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Something has me!
I&#8211;I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s a lobster.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None of us boys missing!&#8221; joked Ed, as he
splashed up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lobsters are worth forty cents a pound!
Save that one! Save it!&#8221; commanded Norton,
as he came alongside with strong, even strokes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh dear!&#8221; screamed Belle.</p>

<p>She really seemed in distress, but something
nerved her to strike out as she never had before,
and before she knew it she was swimming.</p>

<p>A figure in red guided to her side&#8211;a veritable
mermaid. It was the girl from the lighthouse&#8211;Rosalie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take it slowly&#8211;you are doing lovely!&#8221; she
commended. &#8220;You are swimming!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&#8211;Oh&#8211;I&#8211;I&#8217;m so glad!&#8221; cried Belle.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve always wanted to, but they said I&#8211;I would
be afraid!&#8221;</p>

<p>Rosalie was half supporting her, but really
Belle was doing well, and gaining confidence every
minute. As the lighthouse maid swam past Cora
she managed to whisper:</p>

<p>&#8220;Father wants to see you. Come over when
you can. I think he has had some word from
Aunt Margaret.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span><a id='link_19'></a>CHAPTER IX<br /><span class='h2fs'>GATHERING CLOUDS</span></h2>

<p>The word which the lighthouse keeper had received
was rather indefinite. It was a letter
from his sister, but it only confirmed that which
he already knew.</p>

<p>&#8220;And it doesn&#8217;t give me any address where I
can write to her!&#8221; he complained when Cora
had paid him a visit, in response to the invitation
given by Rosalie during the swim. &#8220;It&#8217;s
postmarked at&#8211;maybe you can see it, my eye-sight
isn&#8217;t what it used to be,&#8221; and he held the
envelope out to Cora.</p>

<p>&#8220;Edmenton,&#8221; she read. &#8220;That&#8217;s in this
State.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but what good would it do to write to
her there?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;She evidently doesn&#8217;t
want me to know where she is. Just read the
letter, Miss.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not long and in effect said that Mrs.
Raymond would not come back to her relatives
until she had found Nancy Ford, and cleared her
name of the suspicion on it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t try to find me,&#8221; wrote Mrs. Raymond,
&#8220;as I am going from place to place, working
where I can. I am seeking Nancy. I thought
she might have gone back where she used to live,
but I wrote there and she had not arrived. I
must search farther. I am doing fairly well, so
don&#8217;t worry about me. Some folks have been
very kind&#8211;especially some young ladies. I will
tell you about them when I see you, brother&#8211;if
I ever do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She must mean you&#8211;the time of the fire,&#8221;
said the light keeper. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m much
obliged to you for befriending my sister.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it was nothing,&#8221; protested Cora. &#8220;I
wish we could have done more. I am sure we
could have, had she not gone off in such a hurry.
But we can&#8217;t blame her, for she was very nervous
and excited.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor Margaret,&#8221; murmured Mr. Haley.
&#8220;She was always that way. She tells me not to
worry&#8211;but I can&#8217;t help it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose not,&#8221; agreed Cora. &#8220;You might
try writing to Edmenton. The postmaster there
might give you a clue, or tell you some one who
could give information.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it!&#8221; exclaimed the keeper of the light.
&#8220;It will give me something to do, anyhow,&#8221; and
he set to the task.</p>

<p>Cora had called at the light alone, not knowing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>
what the nature of the communication might be
that the keeper wished to make to her. It was
the day after Belle had bravely struck out for
herself in the water.</p>

<p>Cora said good-bye to Rosalie, who was busy
about her household duties, and waved to little
Dick, who was playing on the beach. Then, getting
into the <i>Pet</i> in which she had come to the
lighthouse float, Cora turned the bow toward the
little dock at the foot of the slope on which the
bungalows were perched.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you were gone long enough!&#8221; complained
Jack when she got back. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been
waiting for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;Has anything
happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing except that we fellows have heard
of a motor boat we can hire cheap for the season,
and we want to run over and look at it. The fellow
who has it is on the other side of the Cove.
Can I take the <i>Pet</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, Jack. We girls are going to the
life-saving station, anyhow. You&#8217;ll be back before
lunch; won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should guess yes!&#8221; exclaimed Walter, who
had come up. &#8220;We wouldn&#8217;t miss our rations
for anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack and his chums were soon speeding across
the bay. There was quite a sea on, for the wind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span>
was rising, and there seemed to be indications of
a storm. But a number of boats were out on the
water, and the <i>Pet</i> was a staunch craft. Also,
Jack and the other boys were able to manage her,
and all were excellent swimmers.</p>

<p>Cora and the girls went on to the life-saving
station not far from their bungalow. They were
much interested in the method of launching the
boat, and the captain explained how it would
right itself if capsized, and also bail out the
water that entered in a storm.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you do when you can&#8217;t launch a
boat?&#8221; asked Belle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Use the breeches buoy,&#8221; answered the grizzled
old salt. He showed how by means of a
mortar a line was fired aboard the wreck, and
how, by a sort of pulley arrangement, the persons
in danger could, one at a time, be pulled ashore,
sitting in the &#8220;breeches buoy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just like some of those apartment house
clothes lines on high poles,&#8221; said Bess; &#8220;isn&#8217;t
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never heard it called that afore,&#8221; remarked
the captain of the coast guard, &#8220;but I s&#8217;pose you
could call it that if you was a mind to. If you&#8217;ll
stay around a bit you&#8217;ll see our drill.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girls were delighted, and eagerly watched
while the mortar was fired, the cylindrical shot
carrying the line out to an imaginary wreck.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span>
Then one man played the part of a shipwrecked
mariner, and was hauled over the sand, while
Cora took several photographs of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got her!&#8221; exclaimed Jack, as the girls
returned to the bungalow. &#8220;She isn&#8217;t much for
looks, but she can beat the <i>Pet</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221; asked Cora, thinking of something
else.</p>

<p>&#8220;The motor boat we hired. Come on out
and we&#8217;ll give you a race.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s!&#8221; exclaimed Belle.</p>

<p>&#8220;My, but you&#8217;re getting brave!&#8221; observed Ed.
&#8220;The time was when a race frightened you even
if you read of it in the papers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She can swim now,&#8221; commented Bess.</p>

<p>Motor maids and motor boys went out on the
bay in the two motor boats. The craft Jack and
his chums had hired was not very elegant, and
she seemed to be rather uncertain about starting,
and when she did the engine appeared to be protesting
most of the while. But the boat made
good time, and though it did not really beat the
<i>Pet</i> (much to the disappointment of boastful
Jack) it kept well up with Cora&#8217;s speedy craft.</p>

<p>For a week or more the young people enjoyed
to the utmost the life on the coast. More people
came to the little summer resort, and several social
affairs were arranged.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>There were swimming races, in which the girls
and boys participated, even Belle entering in the
novice class. But she won no prize, nor did she
expect to.</p>

<p>&#8220;I just wanted to show Jack Kimball that I
didn&#8217;t have to wear a life preserver nor be anchored
to the shore!&#8221; she declared with spirit.</p>

<p>&#8220;I humbly beg your pardon!&#8221; said Jack, with
a bow.</p>

<p>Then there were motor boat races, in which
the <i>Pet</i> did herself proud, coming in first in her
class. The boys had great hopes of the <i>Duck</i>,
as they had re-named the boat they hired, but
when they were doing well, and not far from the
finish line, with every prospect of winning, something
went wrong with the ignition, and they were
out of it.</p>

<p>There were affairs on shore too, several
dances to which the girls and boys went.
Then there was a moving picture performance
semi-occasionally, and some other plays. Altogether
the summer was a happy one, thus
far.</p>

<p>Nothing was heard of Mrs. Raymond, though
her brother wrote a number of letters, and of
course the missing Nancy Ford was not located.
Though Jack and the boys insisted on staring at
all the pretty strangers they met, playfully insisting
that Nancy might be one of them.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>&#8220;Of course she&#8217;s bound to be good-looking,&#8221;
said Ed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Naturally,&#8221; agreed Jack.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you make that out?&#8221; Cora wanted
to know.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everybody named Nancy is good-looking,&#8221;
asserted Norton, with his lazy drawl.</p>

<p>The girls laughed at this reasoning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go for a long run to-day, Sis!&#8221; proposed
Jack one morning, when he called at the
girls&#8217; bungalow. &#8220;We can take our lunch, run
around the lighthouse point, into the Cove on the
other side, and have a good time. There&#8217;s said
to be good fishing there, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go if the others will,&#8221; she agreed, and
when she proposed it to them the girls were enthusiastic
about it. Soon two merry boatloads
of young people were speeding over the sun-lit
waters of the Cove.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have to go right out on the ocean; don&#8217;t
we?&#8221; asked Belle with a little shiver as she looked
ahead at the expanse of blue water.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only for a little way,&#8221; said Cora. &#8220;Just
round the lighthouse point. Then we&#8217;re in another
bay again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you afraid?&#8221; asked Eline.</p>

<p>&#8220;N&#8211;no,&#8221; said Belle, bravely.</p>

<p>As they went on the sky became overcast, and
Cora looked anxiously at them.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s going to storm, Jack,&#8221; she
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bit of it!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I&#8217;ll ask this
fisherman,&#8221; and he did, getting an opinion that
there would be no storm that day. Reassured,
they went on.</p>

<p>The sea was not a bit rough and even Belle&#8217;s
fears were quelled. They went past the light,
close enough to see Rosalie waving at them.
High up in the tower they could note Mr. Haley
and his helper cleaning the great lantern and lens.</p>

<p>They reached the other bay in due time, but the
gathering clouds grew more menacing, and Cora
was for putting back.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; urged Jack. &#8220;Let&#8217;s stay and eat our
lunch. If it gets too rough we can leave our
boats here and walk back over the point. It
isn&#8217;t far.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the girls consented. The clouds continued
to gather.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span><a id='link_20'></a>CHAPTER XX<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE STORM</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Jack Kimball, I knew we stayed too late!
Now look over there!&#8221; and Cora pointed to the
west, where a bank of dark and angry-looking
vapor piled up in contrast to the lighter-hued
clouds that had caused apprehension earlier in
the day.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right&#8211;blame it all on me&#8211;even if it
rains!&#8221; protested Jack. &#8220;You wanted to stay
as much as we did, Sis.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, perhaps I did,&#8221; admitted Cora. &#8220;But
really we should not have stayed so long. I am
afraid we will be caught in the storm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you really think so, Cora?&#8221; asked Belle,
and she could not keep a quaver out of her voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I&#8217;m any judge we&#8217;re in for a regular
old&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re it, old man!&#8221; and Walter interrupted
Ed, who was evidently on the verge of making
a dire prophecy concerning the weather. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
scare &#8217;em any more than you have to,&#8221; went on
Walter in a low voice, nodding at the girls in the
<i>Pet</i>. &#8220;We may have our hands full as it is.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>&#8220;Do you think so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at those clouds!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was enough. Indeed all were now anxiously
scanning the heavens that seemed to grow blacker
momentarily. The little party, after having had
lunch on the beach of the smaller cove, around
the lighthouse point, were now on their way back
in the two motor boats, and Cora, with a look
aloft, had made the observation to Jack that
opened this chapter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, turn on all the gas you can, Sis, and
we&#8217;ll scud for it,&#8221; called Jack to his sister. &#8220;We
may beat it out yet. If not, we can go ashore almost
any place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Except on the rocks,&#8221; spoke Cora. &#8220;The
worst part will be round the point, in the open
sea.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;ll do it all right,&#8221; asserted Norton,
confidently. &#8220;The wind isn&#8217;t rising much.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boats were close enough together so that
talking from one to the other was easy. They
were headed out toward the open sea, and as
Cora guided her craft she could not help anticipating
apprehensively the heavy rollers that
would be encountered once they were out of the
land-locked shelter. But the bow of the <i>Pet</i> was
high. She was a good craft in rough weather,
and as for the hired <i>Duck</i>, she was built for those
waters.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>&#8220;Let&#8217;s be jolly!&#8221; proposed Jack, for a glance
at the girls in their boat had showed him that
they were on the verge of hysterics. &#8220;Strike
up a song, Ed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give us Nancy Lee,&#8221; suggested Walter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nancy!&#8221; exclaimed Cora. &#8220;I wonder
where that other Nancy is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No telling,&#8221; declared Eline. &#8220;Oh dear! I
hope it doesn&#8217;t rain. This dress spots so!&#8221; and
she looked down at her rather light gown, which
really she ought not to have worn on a water
picnic. Cora had said as much, but Eline&#8211;well,
it must be confessed that she was rather vain.
She had good clothes and she liked to wear them,
not always at appropriate times.</p>

<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t rain!&#8221; asserted Jack. &#8220;Go ahead,
Ed&#8211;sing!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Rocked in the Cradle of the Deep&#8217; would
be most appropriate,&#8221; voiced Norton. &#8220;We are
rocking some.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was indeed getting rougher, and the motor
boats bobbed up and down on the long swells.
But as yet none had broken over the bows. Cora
dreaded this, not because of any particular danger,
but because of the effect it would have on
her chums, particularly Belle, who, try as she
might, could not conquer her nervous dread of
the water.</p>

<p>The boys started a song, and the girls joined
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>
in, but a sudden dash of spray over the <i>Pet&#8217;s</i>
stem brought a scream from Belle that made a
discord, and they all stopped.</p>

<p>Jack, who was steering the <i>Duck</i>, stood up
and looked ahead. They were approaching the
point around which they must go to reach their
own cove.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can we do it, old man?&#8221; asked Walter, in
a low voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll try,&#8221; answered Jack, equally low. &#8220;If
we give up now the girls will get scared. We&#8217;ll
keep on a bit longer, and see where we come out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you get a bit nearer in shore?&#8221; asked
Norton.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s risky,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;It&#8217;s low tide now,
and while this old tub doesn&#8217;t draw much there
are a lot of rocks here and there, sticking almost
up at low water. If we hit on one of them we&#8217;ll
be in the pot for fair. The only thing to do is
to stand out, and trust to luck. Once around the
point we&#8217;ll be all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re coming in,&#8221; said Walter, nodding
toward Cora and the others.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep out! Keep out!&#8221; cried Jack. &#8220;It&#8217;s
dangerous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the girls want to land!&#8221; cried his
sister.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t now. The shore is too rocky.
You&#8217;d pound her hull to pieces. Keep on around
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>
the point. The storm won&#8217;t break for half an
hour yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rather reluctantly Cora put the wheel over.
Yet she recognized the truth of what Jack had
said. It would be dangerous to go ashore there.
And to turn back was equally out of the question,
since the wind was rising. It was at their backs,
and to turn in the heavy sea now running might
mean an upset. To face the waves, too, would be
dangerous. The only chance lay in keeping on.</p>

<p>Jack&#8217;s prophecy about the storm was not borne
out. With a sudden burst of wind, that whipped
the salty spray of the waves over those in both
boats, and a sprinkle of rain that soon became a
downpour, the tempest broke.</p>

<p>The girls screamed, and tried to get under
some bits of canvas that Cora had brought along
to cover the engine. But the wind was so strong,
and the rain so penetrating that it was of little
avail.</p>

<p>&#8220;Head her up into the waves!&#8221; cried Jack.
&#8220;Take &#8217;em bow on, Cora!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course!&#8221; she shouted back, and gripped
the wheel with tense fingers.</p>

<p>A little later they were out on the heaving
ocean. Fortunately the point cut off some of the
wind, and, having the gale at their backs helped
some. But the two motor craft, separated by
some distance now, had no easy time of it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span>&#8220;Oh&#8211;oh!&#8221; moaned Belle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be quiet!&#8221; commanded her sister. &#8220;Look
at Eline!&#8221;</p>

<p>Eline was calm&#8211;that is, comparatively so.</p>

<p>&#8220;But&#8211;but she can swim better than I.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Swim! No one will have to swim!&#8221; said
Cora, not turning around. &#8220;I wonder what&#8217;s the
matter with that man?&#8221; and she pointed to one
in a dory, who seemed to be signalling for help.</p>

<p>Then there came a further burst of the storm,
and the rain came down harder than ever.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span><a id='link_21'></a>CHAPTER XXI<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE WRECK</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;There must certainly be something the matter
with that man!&#8221; exclaimed Cora. She had
fairly to shout to be heard above the noise of the
wind and rain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we daren&#8217;t stop to see what it is,&#8221; said
Belle. &#8220;Oh, do go faster, Cora! Get in quiet
water! I am getting seasick!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you dare!&#8221; cried Bess. &#8220;Think of&#8211;lemons!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to see what is the matter,&#8221; declared
Cora. &#8220;He&#8217;s waving to us!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What about the boys?&#8221; asked Eline.</p>

<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t seem to see him. Besides, they&#8217;re
past him now, and it would be risky to turn back.
I can easily pass near him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man, who was in a power-driven dory, was
waving and shouting now, but the wind carried
his words away. He seemed to be in some difficulty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why doesn&#8217;t he row in out of the storm?&#8221;
asked Bess.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps he has lost his oars,&#8221; suggested
Eline.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>&#8220;Maybe that is the trouble,&#8221; remarked Cora.
&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll soon see.&#8221;</p>

<p>She changed the course of the <i>Pet</i>, though it
was a bit risky for the seas were quartering now,
and the spray came aboard in salty sheets. But
the girls could not get much wetter.</p>

<p>Cora slowed down her engine by means of a
throttle control that extended up near the wheel.
She veered in toward the tossing dory.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; she cried. &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Out of gasoline! Can you lend me a bit so
I can run in? I came out to lift my lobster pots,
but it&#8217;s too rough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gasoline? Yes, we have plenty,&#8221; said Cora.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you some.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t come too close!&#8221; warned the fisherman.
&#8220;Can you put it in a can and toss it to
me? That&#8217;s the best way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try,&#8221; promised Cora, as she cut off all
power. The <i>Pet</i> was now drifting, rising and
falling on the swells. Belle looked very pale,
and Bess was holding her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Find something, and run some gasoline into
it from the carbureter drip,&#8221; directed Cora, as
she clung to the wheel.</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall I find?&#8221; asked Bess.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would an empty olive bottle do?&#8221; asked
Eline.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>&#8220;The very thing!&#8221; cried Cora. &#8220;Has it a
cork?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and one olive in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Throw out the olive, and poke your handkerchief
down in the bottle to dry it out before you
put in the gasoline. Even a drop of the salt
water the olives come in will make trouble in
the gasoline. Hurry!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out!&#8221; cried the fisherman. &#8220;Fend
off!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better do it!&#8221; directed Cora. &#8220;We
have no boat hook!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, I&#8217;ll attend to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two boats were drifting dangerously close
together. The fisherman caught up an oar he
carried for emergencies, and skillfully fended off
the <i>Pet</i>, which was drifting down on him. In the
meanwhile Bess, with the help of Eline, had dried
out the olive bottle, and had filled it with gasoline.</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall I do with it?&#8221; she asked Cora.</p>

<p>&#8220;Throw it to the man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never can throw it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then give it to me,&#8221; and, holding to the
wheel with one hand, with the other Cora tossed
over the bottle of gasoline. The lobsterman
caught it, called his thanks and gave the <i>Pet</i> a
final shove that carried her past him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>&#8220;Can you crank her?&#8221; asked Cora to Bess,
nodding toward the engine.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try!&#8221;</p>

<p>It needed three tries, but finally the motor
started, and the boat surged forward again.
Cora, bringing her head up to the seas, noted
that Jack had started to turn around to come
back to her, but, seeing that the <i>Pet</i> was under
way again, had gone on his own course.</p>

<p>The wind continued to blow, the rain never
ceased and the storm increased apace. But
finally, after a battle with the elements that made
the hearts of the girls quail, they passed the
lighthouse point, and shot around into the quiet
and wind-protected waters of the bay. A little later
they were chugging into the even calmer cove.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh Cora! So frightened as I have been!&#8221;
exclaimed Aunt Susan, as the dripping girls
trooped up the hill to the bungalow. &#8220;Oh, what
a storm!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But we weathered it!&#8221; laughed Cora, shaking
back her damp hair. &#8220;It was a bit scary at
first, but we came out all right. It was fun at
the finish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m never going out again when it&#8217;s cloudy!&#8221;
declared Belle. &#8220;Never!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;ll get used to it,&#8221; said Eline.</p>

<p>Dry garments, hot tea, and supper coming in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>
the order named restored in the girls their natural
happy dispositions. But the storm continued. It
grew worse as darkness advanced, and the wind
rose to a gale. The rain came down in torrents,
and the boys, in spite of rain coats and umbrellas,
were drenched a second time in the short
trip from their bungalow to that of the girls,
when they came to pay a visit.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a wild night,&#8221; declared Jack, as he and
his chums got ready to go back, about ten o&#8217;clock.</p>

<p>&#8220;There must be quite a sea on,&#8221; said Ed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t want to be out in it,&#8221; remarked
Walter.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I beg to be excused,&#8221; came from Norton.</p>

<p>&#8220;Think of the poor sailors,&#8221; said Eline, softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you what I&#8217;d like to do,&#8221; observed Jack.</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; Ed wanted to know.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go over to the lighthouse. It must be great
up in the lantern room in a storm like this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you dare to go!&#8221; cried Cora. &#8220;It
might blow away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No danger,&#8221; said Jack with a laugh. &#8220;But
I&#8217;m not going. Another thing we might do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; demanded Norton.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go out and find a beach patrol. We could
walk up and down with him, and maybe sight
a wreck.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t speak of a wreck!&#8221; begged Bess.
&#8220;A wreck on such a night would be dreadful.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span>&#8220;This is just the kind of a night when they
have wrecks,&#8221; observed Ed, as a blast of wind
and rain shook the bungalow.</p>

<p>As the boys were going out into the storm there
came a dull report, reverberating on the night
air.</p>

<p>&#8220;What was that?&#8221; gasped Cora.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sounded like a gun,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;Maybe
a ship at sea&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a flash in the sky. It was not
lightning, for there was no thunder storm.</p>

<p>&#8220;See!&#8221; exclaimed Eline.</p>

<p>&#8220;The lighthouse,&#8221; ventured Norton.</p>

<p>&#8220;The light is over there,&#8221; and Ed pointed to
the flashing beacon in a different direction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it&#8217;s a rocket from some ship in danger,&#8221;
declared Walter. &#8220;There goes another!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was unmistakably a rocket that went cleaving
through the blackness. It came from off the
lighthouse point.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some ship is in danger, or maybe off her
course,&#8221; spoke Jack. &#8220;Well, we can&#8217;t do anything,
and there&#8217;s no use getting any wetter.
Come on to bed, fellows.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the poor people&#8211;if that is a wreck,&#8221;
murmured Bess.</p>

<p>&#8220;If it was only daylight we might witness some
rescues,&#8221; said Cora. &#8220;But at least let us hope
it is nothing serious.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>It was Rosalie who brought the news next
morning. Through the driving rain she came to
the girls&#8217; bungalow, her face peering out from
beneath a sou&#8217;wester that was tied under her chin,
her feet barely visible beneath the yellow oilskin
coat.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a wreck ashore!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;I
thought maybe you might like to see it! It&#8217;s out
in front of our light, and they&#8217;re bringing the
crew ashore!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can they save them?&#8221; asked Cora, clasping
her hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Most of &#8217;em, I guess. Want to come?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course we&#8217;ll go!&#8221; cried Eline. &#8220;The
boys won&#8217;t want to miss this!&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span><a id='link_22'></a>CHAPTER XXII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE RESCUE</span></h2>

<p>Green masses of foam-capped water hurling
themselves on the sand&#8211;thundering and pounding.
A spray that whipped into your face with
the sting of a lash. The wind howling overhead
and picking up handfuls of wet sand, scattering
them about to add to the bite of the salt water.
The rain pelting down in torrents. A dull boom,
repeated again and again. The hissing of the
breakers. And, out in the midst, out in a
smother of water, gripped on the sharp rocks
that now and then could be seen raising their
black teeth through the white foam was the ship&#8211;a
wreck.</p>

<p>It was this scene that Cora, the other girls,
and the boys saw as they hurried out to the
lighthouse point. And it was one they never forgot.</p>

<p>They had hurried out when Rosalie brought
the news that in the storm of the night a three-masted
auxiliary schooner had come too far inshore
despite the warning of the light.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>&#8220;Father was up all night tending the lantern,
too!&#8221; she shouted&#8211;she had to shout to be heard
above the roar. &#8220;I helped him,&#8221; she added.
&#8220;But in spite of it the schooner worked in. She
couldn&#8217;t seem to steer properly. We could see
her red and green lights once in a while. Then
the current caught her and nothing could save
her. She went right on the rocks. Her back&#8217;s
broke, Captain Meeker of the life guards said.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can they save the people?&#8221; Cora inquired,
as she pulled her raincoat more tightly about her,
for the wind seemed fairly to whip open the buttons.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re going to try,&#8221; answered the lighthouse
maid. &#8220;They got some of &#8217;em off in the
motor life-boat early this morning, but it&#8217;s too
rough for that now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are they going to do, then?&#8221; asked
Bess.</p>

<p>&#8220;Use the breeches buoy. It&#8217;s the only way
now!&#8221; cried Rosalie. &#8220;They&#8217;re going to fire a
line over soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t want to miss that,&#8221; declared Jack.</p>

<p>The wreck had gone on the rocks nearly opposite
the lighthouse that guarded them. In this
case the guardianship had been in vain, and the
sea was hastening to wreak further havoc on the
gallant ship.</p>

<p>The boys and girls trudged down to the beach
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>
through sand that clung to their feet. They
could see the life-savers getting their apparatus
in order, and near them were huddled some men&#8211;evidently
sailors.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those are the men who were rescued from
the ship,&#8221; said Rosalie. &#8220;There are more on
board, and some passengers, I heard. Some
women and children, too!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How terrible!&#8221; gasped Belle. &#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t
see how any one can take a long voyage.
I am so afraid of the water.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t blame you&#8211;not when it acts this
way,&#8221; spoke Eline. &#8220;It makes me shudder!&#8221;</p>

<p>The big green waves seemed to be reaching
hungrily out for those on the strand, as though
not satisfied with having wrecked the ship. The
waters fairly flung themselves at the men whose
seemingly puny efforts were being directed to save
those yet remaining on board.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is the ship&#8217;s captain among them?&#8221; asked
Walter, pointing to the group of sailors.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed!&#8221; exclaimed Rosalie. &#8220;He&#8217;ll be
the last one to leave. They&#8217;re always like that.
My father was a captain once,&#8221; and she seemed
proud of the fact, though now she was glad
that her father was safe in the staunch lighthouse.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so, I forgot,&#8221; remarked Walter.
&#8220;The captain is always the last to leave.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>&#8220;But I thought women and children came
first in a rescue at sea,&#8221; suggested Ed.</p>

<p>&#8220;The women and girls&#8211;I heard there were
some girls,&#8221; went on Rosalie, &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t get in
the boat. They were afraid. Of course the
breeches buoy is safer, but look how they have
to wait. She may go to pieces any time now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s dreadful,&#8221; said Cora, in a low voice.</p>

<p>She and her companions drew closer to where
the life-savers were at work. The boys and girls
were wet, for the rain penetrated through coats,
and umbrellas were impossible. But they did not
mind this, and Mrs. Chester had promised to
have hot coffee for them when they got back to
the bungalow. She had refused to go out to look
at the wreck.</p>

<p>&#8220;I just couldn&#8217;t bear it!&#8221; she had exclaimed
with a shudder.</p>

<p>The guards were burying in the sand a heavy
anchor to which the main rope of the breeches
buoy would be fastened. The other end would be
made fast to the highest part of the ship, so that
the person being pulled ashore in the carrier
would be as far above the waves as possible. The
three masts had been broken off, but the jagged
stump of one stuck up, and could be seen when
there came a momentary lull in the rain.</p>

<p>It was not very cold, though much of the heat
of summer had been dissipated in the cool rain.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>&#8220;If it was winter, how terrible it would be,&#8221;
said Eline. &#8220;Sometimes I have seen lake steamers
just a mass of ice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, there is something to be thankful for,&#8221;
Cora agreed. &#8220;Oh, they are going to fire, I
think.&#8221;</p>

<p>She pointed to where some of the men were
setting the mortar, or small cannon, which is
discharged to send a line to stranded ships. The
mortar fires a long, round piece of iron, to which
is fastened a light, but strong, line. When this
falls aboard the vessel a stronger rope is hauled
from shore by means of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, they&#8217;re going to shoot!&#8221; agreed Jack.
&#8220;They must have trouble keeping their powder
dry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bess covered her ears with her hands and cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, if they&#8217;re going to fire I&#8217;m going to
run!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Silly! It won&#8217;t make much noise!&#8221; exclaimed
Norton. &#8220;They don&#8217;t use a heavy
charge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care. I&#8217;m going to&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>But Bess did not have time to do anything,
for at that moment the captain pulled the lanyard
that set off the mortar. The report was
loud enough, though partly smothered by the
storm.</p>

<p>&#8220;It fell short!&#8221; exclaimed Rosalie, who was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>
watching intently. &#8220;See, it fell into the water!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does that mean they can&#8217;t make the rescue?&#8221;
asked Belle, in an awed voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, they&#8217;ll fire again,&#8221; answered Rosalie.</p>

<p>A guard was hauling in on the line, which
had the weight attached to it. Soon it was in
the mortar again, the line coiled beside it in a
box in a peculiar manner to prevent tangling.</p>

<p>Once more the shot was fired.</p>

<p>&#8220;There it goes! It&#8217;s going to land this time!&#8221;
shouted Rosalie in her excitement. A shout from
the group of rescued seamen, in which the life
guards joined, told that the shot had gone true.</p>

<p>Then began a busy time&#8211;not that the men had
not worked hard before. But there was need of
much haste now, for it was feared the vessel
would break up. Quickly the heavy line was sent
out and made fast. Then the breeches buoy was
rigged, and in a little while a woman was hauled
in from the wreck.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor thing!&#8221; murmured Cora. &#8220;We must
help her. She is drenched.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, we must do something!&#8221; cried Belle.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll take her up to our kitchen,&#8221; proposed
Rosalie. &#8220;There&#8217;s a good fire there, and I&#8217;ll
make coffee.&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman was helped out of the buoy, and
the motor girls went to her assistance. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>
seemed very grateful. She was the wife of one
of the mates, and he was not yet rescued.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will stay here until Harry comes ashore!&#8221;
she declared, firmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you know he won&#8217;t come, Mrs. Madden,
until the rest of the women is saved,&#8221; explained
one of the seamen. &#8220;Go with the young ladies.
That is best,&#8221; and she finally consented.</p>

<p>In a short time several other women and two
girls came ashore, one much exhausted. But by
this time a physician had arrived, and he attended
to her in the lighthouse.</p>

<p>Then the remainder of the sailors were
brought from the wreck, the first one to get
ashore reporting that no more women or girls
remained aboard.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was one girl,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but she
seems to have disappeared.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Washed overboard?&#8221; asked Cora, with a
gasp.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid so, miss. It&#8217;s a terrible storm.&#8221;</p>

<p>Finally the captain himself was hauled off, and
he landed amid cheers from the brave men who
had helped save him. He said the vessel was
now abandoned, and would not last another hour.
In less than that time the wreck was observed to
have changed its position.</p>

<p>Then amid the upheaval of the mighty seas the
ship broke in two and was soon pounded into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>
shreds of wood by the terrible power of the
storm-swept ocean.</p>

<p>The shipwrecked ones were cared for among
the different fishermen, some staying in the lighthouse
and some in the quarters of the life-savers.
The storm kept up harder than ever, and soon
Cora and her friends decided that it would be
unwise to stay out longer in it. So they sought
their bungalows.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span><a id='link_23'></a>CHAPTER XXIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE FLOATING SPARS</span></h2>

<p>Calm followed after the storm. The sea was
sullen, and great waves broke on the beach, but
the rain had ceased, and the wind had almost died
out. But the tide heaved and seemed to moan, as
though in sorrow for what it had done.</p>

<p>It was the morning after the wreck, and Cora
and the girls had gone to the lighthouse to look
out over the ocean. All vestige of the schooner
had disappeared. The sea had eaten her up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are the boys?&#8221; asked Eline, as she
walked along beside Bess. The girls had on rather
make-shift garments, for they had become so
drenched in the rain that their clothes needed
drying.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess they are&#8211;pressing their trousers,&#8221;
remarked Cora. &#8220;Jack said he was going to,
anyhow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Vain creatures!&#8221; mocked Bess.</p>

<p>&#8220;I noticed you doing your hair up more elaborately
than usual,&#8221; remarked Belle, with a glance
at her sister.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span>&#8220;Oh, well, no wonder. It looked frightful&#8211;all
wet as it was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Vain creatures&#8211;all of us,&#8221; murmured Cora.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then the boys won&#8217;t be out for some time,&#8221;
suggested Eline.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think not,&#8221; answered Jack&#8217;s sister. &#8220;I
wonder what has become of all the shipwrecked
people?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A good many of them went on to New York
last night,&#8221; said Belle. &#8220;I met Rosalie early this
morning and she said only two of the women
were over at her place now. How did so many
women, and those girls, come to be on the
schooner?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a sort of excursion party,&#8221; explained
Cora. &#8220;The schooner had an auxiliary gasoline
engine. The company that owns it does a small
freight business, and also takes passengers who
like to go for a cruise. It seems that a party was
made up, and tickets sold. Quite a number of
women and girls, as well as some men, went
along.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess they are sorry they did,&#8221; said Belle.
&#8220;Oh, the dreadful sea. I&#8217;m never going in bathing
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s safe in Sandy Point Cove,&#8221; exclaimed
Eline.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder what happened to the missing
girl?&#8221; asked Bess.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>&#8220;Missing girl?&#8221; echoed Belle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Didn&#8217;t you hear one of the sailors say
a girl was missing&#8211;perhaps swept overboard?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes! Poor thing!&#8221; and Cora sighed.
&#8220;She may be&#8211;out&#8211;there!&#8221; and she waved her
hand to the heaving ocean.</p>

<p>The girls were on the beach where the rescue
had been made. The waves were still pounding
away, but a life-guard who went past on his patrol
remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll be down a lot by night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Were any of your friends hurt?&#8221; asked
Belle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Working yesterday, you mean, miss?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Bill Smith got his hand jammed a bit,
but that was all. We get used to rough treatment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose so. The sea is very rough&#8211;it&#8217;s
cruel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not always, miss. If you could see it&#8211;as
I often do&#8211;all blue under the sun, and shimmering
like&#8211;like your hair, miss, if I may be so
bold, and with the gulls wheeling about, and
dipping down into it&#8211;why, miss, you&#8217;d say the
sea was beautiful&#8211;that&#8217;s it&#8211;just beautiful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but it&#8217;s so often the other way&#8211;terrible&#8211;hideous!&#8221;
murmured Belle, who seemed
strangely affected.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>&#8220;No, miss, begging your pardon. Even in a
storm I love the sea. It it&#8217;s just grand, miss!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m glad you can think so. I can&#8217;t. It
makes me&#8211;shiver!&#8221; and a fit of trembling seized
her.</p>

<p>The girls walked on. Some refuse&#8211;bits of
wood and part of the cargo from the wreck&#8211;was
coming ashore. The girls continued on
down the strand, now and then venturing too
close to the water, and being compelled to run
back when a higher wave than usual rushed up
the shingle.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if we couldn&#8217;t go out in the boat?&#8221;
spoke Cora at length.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you dare suggest such a thing&#8211;to
me!&#8221; cried Belle. &#8220;I&#8217;ll never go out again&#8211;after
that terrible wreck!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t mean out on the ocean,&#8221; said
Cora. &#8220;I mean just around the cove. It isn&#8217;t
at all rough there, and you won&#8217;t mind it a bit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do come!&#8221; begged Eline.</p>

<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t a bit of danger,&#8221; urged Bess.
&#8220;Why, you&#8217;ve often been out when there was
more sea than this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But not so soon after a wreck.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What has that to do with it?&#8221; Cora wanted
to know. &#8220;The wreck is over. It wasn&#8217;t a bad
one, except that the ship was lost. All the
people were saved. I think it was wonderful.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>&#8220;All but that poor girl,&#8221; murmured Belle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we can&#8217;t even be sure there was such
a person,&#8221; remarked Eline. &#8220;It was only a
rumor, and really, Rosalie said the captain could
account for everyone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You never can tell when there are a number
of people,&#8221; supplemented Cora. &#8220;Perhaps this
girl had her name down on the list, and, after
all, did not go. Then, when she was looked for,
and not found, they jumped to the conclusion that
she had gone overboard. I&#8217;ve often read of
such cases.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So have I,&#8221; declared Bess. &#8220;Come on,
Belle. Let&#8217;s go for a ride. It will do us all
good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well, I don&#8217;t want to be a spoil-sport
I&#8217;ll go; but, Cora, dear, you must take along a
couple of life preservers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A dozen if you like, Belle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;ll promise not to go outside the bay&#8211;you&#8217;ll
stay where it&#8217;s calm?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I promise!&#8221; exclaimed Cora, raising her
right hand.</p>

<p>Rosalie came out of the lighthouse in her bathing
suit.</p>

<p>&#8220;That girl fairly lives in the water,&#8221; said
Eline.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I could swim as she does I would too,&#8221;
spoke Bess.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; called Rosalie, genially. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it
lovely after the storm?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Cora. &#8220;Have they heard anything
more about the missing girl?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. And no one seems to know who she
was. Are you going for a spin?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We thought of it. Would you like to
come?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d just love it! Only I haven&#8217;t time to
change, perhaps, and I don&#8217;t want to&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come just as you are&#8211;in your bathing suit,&#8221;
invited Cora, and Rosalie did.</p>

<p>The boys must have finished pressing their trousers,
or attending to whatever part of the personal
attire needed attention, for when the girls
got back to the float, and were getting the <i>Pet</i>
in shape for a spin, Jack and Ed hurried down
to look over the <i>Duck</i>. Both boats needed
pumping out, for the water had rained in, and
Walter and Norton were good enough to attend
to this tiresome work for the girls.</p>

<p>Soon the two craft were moving over the sparkling
waters of the Cove, which seemed to be trying
to make up for what the sea had done the day
before.</p>

<p>The boats kept close together, and talk and
gay laughter passed back and forth. Then Jack
and his chums, declaring they were going to see
how far out toward the sea they could venture
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>
with safety, speeded up and left Cora and the
girls in the <i>Pet</i> somewhat behind. But they did
not mind&#8211;in fact, Belle insisted on keeping in
safe waters. Nor was Cora averse to this.</p>

<p>The girls had been cruising about for perhaps
an hour when Eline called:</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that over there?&#8221;</p>

<p>She pointed to a dark mass on the surface of
the bay. Rosalie stood up to look.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a lot of spars lashed together,&#8221; she reported.
&#8220;A sort of raft. Maybe it is from the
wrecked vessel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then if it&#8217;s a raft there is some one on it!&#8221;
cried Eline.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span><a id='link_24'></a>CHAPTER XXIV<br /><span class='h2fs'>SAFE ASHORE</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a girl!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Cora who said this as the motor boat
drew close to the floating logs.</p>

<p>&#8220;A girl!&#8221; echoed Belle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; can&#8217;t you see her long hair?&#8221;</p>

<p>All the girls were standing up&#8211;even Cora,
who had to bend over to maintain her grip on the
steering wheel. They all peered anxiously toward
the floating object.</p>

<p>Certainly that was a figure on it&#8211;a figure of
a girl&#8211;sea-drenched and washed over by each
succeeding wave.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s tied fast to that raft!&#8221; cried Bess.</p>

<p>&#8220;And her head is up on a sort of box&#8211;that
keeps her mouth out of the water,&#8221; added Eline.
&#8220;Oh, but she looks&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say it!&#8221; commanded Cora, sharply,
and Eline stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, if only the boys were here!&#8221; breathed
Bess. &#8220;They could help us&#8211;help her,&#8221; and she
motioned to the limp figure on the raft.</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t need the boys!&#8221; exclaimed Cora,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>
sharply. &#8220;We can make the rescue ourselves.
That is if&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say it!&#8221; commanded Eline, thus &#8220;getting
back&#8221; at Cora.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, do steer over there!&#8221; begged Bess, as
Cora did not seem to be bringing the motor boat
quickly enough toward the raft of spars. &#8220;We
must get to her!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going to,&#8221; answered Cora.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, do you suppose she can be from the
wreck?&#8221; asked Belle.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think very likely,&#8221; spoke Cora.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those spars&#8211;they are from the ship,&#8221; declared
Rosalie. &#8220;They are broken pieces of the
masts, perhaps. Some one must have made a raft
before the vessel broke up, and she lashed herself
to it. I have often heard my father tell of
such things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, do get her, Cora!&#8221; exclaimed Belle,
clasping her hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go too close,&#8221; warned the lighthouse
maid. &#8220;Some of those spars have jagged ends,
and a bump would mean a hole in your boat, Miss
Kimball.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t, for mercy&#8217;s sake!&#8221; voiced Bess, clutching
Cora&#8217;s arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;And don&#8217;t you do that to my arm or I can&#8217;t
steer,&#8221; came the retort. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be careful.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the motor boat came nearer the girls could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>
see more plainly the figure on the raft. It was
that of a young girl, with light hair, that was
now darkened by the sea water. She seemed to
have wrapped herself in some blankets, or rugs,
tying them about her waist, and then had lashed
herself fast to the spars, or some seaman had
done it for her.</p>

<p>She sat with her head against a box, which
seemed to be nailed to the raft, and several turns
of rope were passed about this in such a manner
as to maintain the girl in a half-reclining position.</p>

<p>The waves broke over the lower part of her
body, but her head was out of the water, though
whether this had been the case when the raft
was in the open sea was a question. Clearly
much water must have washed over the raft, and
perhaps the buffeting of the waves had rendered
her unconscious.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out!&#8221; warned Rosalie, as Cora sent
the boat in a graceful sweep toward the raft.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t go any nearer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But we must save her!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then let me try. I&#8217;ll dive overboard and
swim to the raft. Then I can loosen the ropes
and we&#8217;ll see what can be done toward getting
her aboard. But be careful of your
boat.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was good advice and Cora followed it. Rosalie
stood on the stern, poised for a moment
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>
as Cora cut down the speed, and then gracefully
dived overboard.</p>

<p>Up she came, shaking the water from her eyes,
and struck out for the raft</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s alive&#8211;and&#8211;that&#8217;s all!&#8221; called Rosalie
to the girls in the motor boat, as she bent over
the one on the raft. &#8220;We must get her to a
doctor quick!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can we get her into the boat?&#8221; asked
Cora.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll loosen the ropes, and then you can come
up on this side. The spars are smooth here and
your boat won&#8217;t be damaged!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor creature!&#8221; murmured Belle, as she
watched Rosalie in her dripping bathing suit bending
over the girl on the raft.</p>

<p>The ropes were soon loosed, and then, with
no small skill, Cora brought the <i>Pet</i> alongside
the raft. It was not an easy matter to get the
limp and unconscious figure into the boat, but the
girls managed it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now for shore and the doctor!&#8221; cried Eline.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is her valise,&#8221; called Rosalie, casting
loose a rope that held a small suit case to the
raft. &#8220;May as well take that, but I guess the
things in it are pretty well soaked. She must
have been adrift ever since the wreck went to
pieces.&#8221;</p>

<p>She tossed the bag into the boat, and clambered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span>
in herself. Then Cora steered away from the
raft, as Belle started the motor. They covered
the rescued girl with her own wet rugs&#8211;it was
all they could do. She was breathing&#8211;that was
all.</p>

<p>Half an hour later they were safe ashore, and
two fishermen on the beach had carried the girl
up to the bungalow. A doctor was telephoned
for in haste.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span><a id='link_25'></a>CHAPTER XXV<br /><span class='h2fs'>A SURPRISE</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Poor, poor girl!&#8221; murmured Cora. She
was bending over the unknown who had been rescued
from the raft. The girl lay in a stupor on a
couch in the living room, having been made as
comfortable as possible under the circumstances,
the girls having ministered to her with the aid of
Mrs. Chester.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder who she can be?&#8221; said Belle.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall have to interview some of those
who were saved from the wreck,&#8221; spoke Bess.
&#8220;One or two of the women, and two of the men
are still here, staying with some of the fishermen,
I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They might know,&#8221; remarked Eline, &#8220;but if
we could look at the passenger list that would
tell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where could we get it?&#8221; asked Cora.</p>

<p>&#8220;The captain may have saved it, but of course
he is gone. Perhaps he took it with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll ask my father,&#8221; said Rosalie. &#8220;The
captain may have left it, or a copy of it, at the
lighthouse. I&#8217;ll ask Daddy.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>The lighthouse maid had gotten out of her
bathing suit on the arrival of the motor boat in
the cove, and, in her ordinary attire had come
over to the bungalow where the rescued girl was
still in a state of unconsciousness.</p>

<p>&#8220;That will be a good idea,&#8221; said Cora. &#8220;I
wish you would. But I don&#8217;t see why that doctor
doesn&#8217;t hurry. Perhaps we had better telephone
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it,&#8221; offered Belle. &#8220;But perhaps we
ought to try and revive her ourselves&#8211;some ammonia&#8211;&#8221;
and she looked at Cora questioningly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had rather not,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;We
don&#8217;t know what injury we might do her. She
may have been struck on the head, or something
like that. I had rather a doctor would examine
her. Poor creature. Who can she be?&#8221;</p>

<p>No one could tell. The strange girl was
pretty, and her light brown hair, now drying out,
clustered around her pale face that looked so
much like death that the motor girls were greatly
affected by it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Her people must be terribly worried about
her,&#8221; said Eline, softly. &#8220;Just think of it! They
will read of the wreck in the newspapers, and see
the list of those saved. Her name will not be
among them, and they will think her drowned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is so,&#8221; agreed Cora. &#8220;Oh, why doesn&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>
that doctor hurry? If we could revive her she
would tell her name and we could notify her folks.
I&#8217;ve a good notion&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>Cora started for the telephone just as the bell
rang. Cora snapped the receiver down from the
hook.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8211;yes!&#8221; the others heard her say eagerly.
&#8220;Oh, that is too bad! Your car has broken
down while you were coming here? Yes, of
course we want you! We have a strange case
here. Wait! I&#8217;ll tell you what I&#8217;ll do. I&#8217;ll come
for you in my own car!&#8221;</p>

<p>Cora turned to her friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just think of it!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Dr. Brown&#8217;s
car broke down while he was on his way here.
He&#8217;s over at Siconset and I&#8217;ll go over and get
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then take our car!&#8221; suggested Bess. &#8220;It&#8217;s
just been filled with oil and gasoline. Yours may
not have any in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will, thank you. You come with me, Bess;
Belle and Eline can look after things until we
get back. It isn&#8217;t far.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh dear!&#8221; exclaimed Belle. &#8220;What&#8211;what
will I do if she wakes up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t be nervous!&#8221; exclaimed Cora, vigorously.
&#8220;If she comes to her senses so much
the better. Get her something warm to drink.
She may be starving.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>&#8220;Very likely she is,&#8221; said Mrs. Chester. &#8220;Run
along, Cora. We&#8217;ll look after things here.
Bring the doctor as soon as you can.&#8221;</p>

<p>Outside Cora found Jack and the other boys
anxiously waiting news of what was going on.
They cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has she come to yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did she happen to be on the raft?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has she told you her story?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t stop to talk now!&#8221; she replied. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
got to go for the doctor. Jack, be a good boy,
and run the <i>Flyaway</i> out for me. Bess and I are
going in that for Dr. Brown. He&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you telephone for him long ago?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but his car broke down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see. I&#8217;ll have the flyer here in a minute.
Don&#8217;t you want my car? It&#8217;s lighter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or mine?&#8221; asked Norton eagerly, anxious to
be of some service.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you both&#8211;no. Bess and I will make
out all right. We don&#8217;t know who the girl is, nor
what&#8217;s the matter. Get the car, Jack, do.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys, who had come back from their little
trip shortly after the girls had made the strange
rescue, talked about the happening, while Jack
ran the <i>Flyaway</i> out from the shed where it was
kept with the other cars. Soon Cora and Bess
were on their way to pick up the physician.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span>&#8220;She must have received a blow on the head.
That is the only way I can account for her long
stupor. Or perhaps she has received some severe
mental shock. Of course the exposure and
the fright of the wreck would add to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Dr. Brown who spoke this way after
examining the girl from the raft. Cora and
Bess had made good time to get the medical man
and bring him back to the bungalow.</p>

<p>&#8220;But she is coming around now,&#8221; went on the
physician. &#8220;We will have her opening her eyes
in a moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps the sight of this may help her when
she begins to come to her senses,&#8221; suggested Rosalie,
bringing in the suitcase that had been on
the raft with the girl. &#8220;She seemed to value it
very much, to take it with her in the time of
the excitement of the wreck,&#8221; she went on. The
bag had been lost sight of in the confusion of
bringing the strange girl to the bungalow and in
sending for the doctor. In fact, the other girls
had almost forgotten that such a thing existed.</p>

<p>Rosalie now brought it in, sodden and damp
from the sea water. She placed it on the floor
near the couch on which the girl lay.</p>

<p>Idly Cora glanced at the suitcase. Some letters
on it caught her eyes. They were partly
obliterated, either by abrasion, or the action of
the sea water, but Cora could see that they formed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>
a name. She leaned forward, and read half
aloud:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>&#8220;Nancy Ford.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Girls! Girls!&#8221; Cora exclaimed. &#8220;Look&#8211;we
have found her&#8211;the missing girl that Mrs.
Raymond wanted so much to find. Nancy Ford!
There she is!&#8221; and she pointed to the girl on the
couch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nancy Ford!&#8221; repeated Belle. &#8220;Who&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean to say you don&#8217;t remember?&#8221;
cried Cora. &#8220;The fire in our garage&#8211;the
strange woman&#8211;the story she told&#8211;of the
robbers&#8211;of Nancy Ford disappearing. There
is Nancy Ford!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look! her name is on the valise!&#8221; Cora
pointed a slightly-trembling finger at it. &#8220;She is
our waif from the sea. Oh, if she will explain
things&#8211;if only everything is all right&#8211;and we
could find Mrs. Raymond!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps&#8211;perhaps the missing money is in&#8211;that
bag, girls!&#8221; whispered Belle.</p>

<p>The doctor turned around.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please keep a little quiet,&#8221; he suggested.
&#8220;She will revive in a few seconds, and I don&#8217;t
want her to have too much of a shock. She will
be all right, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To think that we have found Nancy Ford!&#8221;
exclaimed Cora in a tense voice, but the room was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span>
so silent just then that it sounded louder than it
otherwise would have done.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is calling me?&#8221; came suddenly from the
girl on the sofa. She sat up, looked around with
big, staring eyes, in which the wonder grew as
she noted the room and those in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who said Nancy Ford?&#8221; she demanded
again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Easy, my dear, easy,&#8221; said Dr. Brown, softly.
&#8220;You are with friends and you are all right.
Drink this,&#8221; and he held some medicine to her
lips. The girl drank unresistingly and then lay
back again on the pillows.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span><a id='link_26'></a>CHAPTER XXVI<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE STORY OF NANCY FORD</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;When do you think we can talk to her&#8211;question
her?&#8221; asked Cora of Dr. Brown. It
was some hours after Nancy had regained her
senses. She had been fed some nourishing broth,
and moved into a spare bedroom, where she was
made comfortable.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it absolutely necessary to question her?&#8221;
the physician asked in turn.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to be important,&#8221; returned Cora.
&#8220;If she is really Nancy Ford a great deal depends
on it. She may be able to clear the name
of a woman who has suffered much. If we could
question her, learn her story, we might be able
to help both her and the woman in question, Mrs.
Raymond, who is a sister of Mr. Haley.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, the light keeper. I understood there
was some mystery about his sister.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She has disappeared, and is searching for this
very girl we rescued from the sea,&#8221; went on
Cora. &#8220;I do not wish to make her ill, or disturb
her, but if we could hear her story we might
be able to act.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span>&#8220;Hum, yes!&#8221; mused Dr. Brown. &#8220;Well, I
think by evening she will be strong enough to talk.
I want her to rest now. Yes, you may question
her then. I shall leave some medicine for her,
but principally she needs rest, and light but nourishing
food. There is nothing serious the matter
with her. She has received no injury that I can
find. The shock and the fright caused her
to lose her senses&#8211;that and being almost
starved.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor girl! Out all alone&#8211;all night&#8211;on the
ocean on that raft,&#8221; remarked Cora.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should have died!&#8221; sighed Belle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, human nature can stand more than we
think,&#8221; spoke the doctor. &#8220;Well, I must be going.
I don&#8217;t know how I am to get around
without my car.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Use mine!&#8221; offered Jack, quickly. &#8220;I shan&#8217;t
need it. The old <i>Get There</i> needs running to
keep her in good humor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, I will, and thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Brown looked in on his patient.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is sleeping,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is good,&#8221; murmured Cora. &#8220;But, oh!
I do wish we could hear her story.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The fellows are anxious, too,&#8221; said Jack, he
being alone allowed in his sister&#8217;s bungalow at
this time.</p>

<p>There was a period of anxious waiting by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span>
Cora and her friends. Rosalie had gone back
to the lighthouse to see if there was a duplicate
list of the passengers on the wrecked schooner.
She had come back to report that her father had
none, and did not know where one could be obtained.
The few members of the ship&#8217;s company
remaining in the village could throw no light on
the waif of the sea who had been so strangely
picked up. Undoubtedly she was the girl supposed
to have been washed overboard.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is asking for you,&#8221; reported Mrs. Chester,
coming from the room of the girl that evening
after supper. &#8220;She wants you, Cora.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure she said me, Aunt Susan?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, she described you. She seems to be
worried about something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will see her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cora went into the room softly. The girl&#8211;Nancy
Ford&#8211;to give her the name on her valise,
which had not been opened, was propped up amid
the pillows. She had some color in her cheeks
now, and there was eager excitement in her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;How are you&#8211;Nancy Ford?&#8221; greeted Cora,
pleasantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not Nancy Ford&#8211;how&#8211;how&#8211;why do
you call me that name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is on your valise.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl started.</p>

<p>&#8220;My valise! Oh, yes! Was that saved? Oh,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span>
dear, I am so miserable! Yes, I am Nancy Ford.
I don&#8217;t know why I said I was not. But I have
been in such trouble&#8211;I haven&#8217;t a friend in the
world, and&#8211;and&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>She burst into tears.</p>

<p>Instantly Cora was beside her, putting her
arms around the frail figure in the bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am your friend,&#8221; said Cora, softly. &#8220;You
may trust me&#8211;trust all of us. We are so glad
we found you. Mrs. Raymond will be glad,
also.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Raymond!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a startled cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&#8211;why, isn&#8217;t she still in the office? When&#8211;when
I ran away she was there, and, oh! I
didn&#8217;t dare go back. I&#8211;I was so afraid of those
men. One of them&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait, my dear,&#8221; said Cora, gently. &#8220;Perhaps
it will be too much for you to talk now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, that is why I sent for you. I wanted to
tell you all. At first I decided that I would say
nothing, but you have been so kind that I decided
I must. Oh, that dreadful wreck! I shall
never forget it. Poor Mrs. Raymond! And she
is gone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and we do not know where. Suppose
I tell you how I came to meet her, and what
happened?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span>&#8220;Then I can tell you my story,&#8221; answered
Nancy. &#8220;Please do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;First drink this,&#8221; and Cora gave some of the
medicine that had been left by the doctor.</p>

<p>As briefly as she could Cora related the incident
of the fire, and story told by Mrs. Raymond.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is just how it happened,&#8221; said Nancy,
with a sigh. &#8220;Oh, I little thought when I ran
out of the office that I would cause such suffering
to an innocent woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then she is innocent?&#8221; asked Cora, eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course she is!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I am so glad! I thought she was all the
while. Now, dear, if it won&#8217;t tire you too much,
please tell me as much as you wish to. Then I
will let the other girls know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I am Nancy Ford. I am sorry I denied
it, but&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right, my dear. I understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nancy struggled with her emotion for a moment,
and resumed slowly, with frequent pauses
to compose herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;My parents died some time ago, and left considerable
property to me,&#8221; said Nancy. &#8220;Not a
big fortune, of course, but enough so that I had
to have a guardian appointed by the court. And
that made all the trouble. At first Mr. Rickford
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211'></a>211</span>
Cross, my guardian, was very nice. He helped
me by advice, and suggested that I go to a boarding
school.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did so, and spent some years there. Then,
as the securities papa had left me increased in
value, I began to think that perhaps I ought to
know more about my own affairs, and not leave
everything to my guardian. So, without consulting
him, I left the boarding school, and went to
a business college. He did not find it out for
some time, as he was abroad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps I did wrong, but I wanted to know
how to attend to my business when I had to. Oh,
but Mr. Cross was very angry when he found it
out. He wanted me to go back to boarding
school, but I refused. I said I wanted some
practical experience in an office, and, after some
argument, he consented, and got me in the place
where Mrs. Raymond worked. I liked her very
much.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think my guardian must have had some
business dealings with the man who ran the office.
They were often together and finally I began to
suspect that all was not right. I think Mrs. Raymond
did also.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then my guardian and Mr. Hopwood, the
man I worked for, had a violent quarrel. My
guardian threatened to take me out of the
place, and send me back to boarding school,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span>
for he was angry at me because I would not
give him certain papers from my employer&#8217;s
desk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then my guardian insisted that I come to
live with him and his wife. I did not want to,
for I did not like either of them. But they made
me go, and oh, the life I led!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It must have been hard,&#8221; said Cora.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was, dreadfully so. I was virtually a prisoner.
Finally I decided to run away, and do
anything rather than submit to my guardian. I
hated and feared him. I got together what
money I could, and it was a good sum, for my
quarterly allowance had just been paid. Usually
after I got it my guardian would take it away
from me and dole out small sums. But this time
he had no chance.</p>

<p>&#8220;So I ran away! It was hard to do, but it
was harder to stay. I left the house one morning,
taking my suitcase with me. I stopped in the
office, intending to say good-bye to Mrs. Raymond,
and when I had been there a little while
my guardian suddenly came in with another man. I
did not know him, but I feared my guardian had
come to take me back. I screamed and ran out
in fright before they could detain me. I have
never been back, so of course I don&#8217;t know what
happened to poor Mrs. Raymond. I did not tell
her my story, and she did not know that the man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213'></a>213</span>
I so feared and ran away from was my guardian.
Oh, I didn&#8217;t know what to do!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not,&#8221; agreed Cora, soothingly. &#8220;I
can piece the story together now.</p>

<p>&#8220;After you left Mrs. Raymond either fainted,
or was made unconscious by one of the two men&#8211;your
guardian or the other. She doesn&#8217;t quite
know what happened except that when she came
to her senses you were gone, the money was missing
and the men had vanished. She told all she
knew, but her story was not believed, and her
employer suspected her of taking the money. In
great distress she hurried away, and, after some
happenings she was found in our burning garage.
I did not have a chance to ask all the particulars.
But she did so want to find you, to know why
you ran away, and who the men were you
seemed to fear. She may still be searching for
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t want to meet her!&#8221; cried Nancy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She may&#8211;she may be in league with my
guardian.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed&#8211;impossible!&#8221; cried Cora. &#8220;We
will see that you are fully protected. I will communicate
with my mother&#8217;s lawyer at once, if you
will allow me. There is such a thing as having
a guardian removed, you know. The courts will
protect you.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214'></a>214</span>&#8220;And oh, I do seem to need protection!&#8221;
sighed Nancy.</p>

<p>&#8220;You poor girl!&#8221; and again Cora&#8217;s arms went
around her. &#8220;I will telegraph mother at once.
We will have the lawyer come here!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, can you do that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly I will, my dear. You need a new
guardian most of all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, if I may only have one. Then I will be
happy again. And I can clear the name of Mrs.
Raymond, for I am sure either my guardian, or
the other man, took that money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They must have. But you have not told how
you came to be in the wreck.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that was a mere accident. After I ran
away I went from place to place, fearing my
guardian might trace me, for I am sure his object
was to get all my property into his hands. I
heard of this sailing voyage, and I put my name
down in the passenger list. I thought a sea trip
would do me good, for I love the water. Then
came the terrible storm&#8211;and they said the ship
was sinking. Some of the sailors made a raft, but
did not launch it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was afraid to go in the boats, and more
afraid of being pulled in on the rope. So I got
a little food together, took my suitcase, and tied
myself to the raft. I knew it would float, and I
hoped to be picked up. Then the storm grew
worse. The vessel was all in confusion, for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215'></a>215</span>
rescue was going on. No one noticed me. Then
the ship went to pieces, and I lost my senses. The
raft must have launched itself, and I floated on it.
That is all I know until I found myself here. Oh,
I can never thank you enough for all you
did!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was nothing,&#8221; said Cora. &#8220;If we could
only find Mrs. Raymond now we could complete
the story; and she will be so glad to know that
you can clear her name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but I shudder when I think I have to
meet my guardian to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will not have to,&#8221; promised Cora. &#8220;I
will see to that, Nancy dear!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are too good!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense. Anyone would be good to you
after all you have suffered. Now rest, dearie,
and I will tell the others all about you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They won&#8217;t blame me; will they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed not! They are all so interested in
you, even the boys.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you boys here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, my brother and his chums. I will tell
you about them later. You will like them, I
think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure I shall. Oh, but it is such a relief
to tell this to you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad it was, my dear. Now rest. I
am sure you must be tired. The doctor will be
here this evening.&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216'></a>216</span><a id='link_27'></a>CHAPTER XXVII<br /><span class='h2fs'>A BOLD ATTEMPT</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it romantic?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And to think of all that poor girl suffered!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to get hold of that miserable guardian
of hers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She has pluck, all right, to get out and hustle
for herself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t she pretty!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do hope she gets all over her exposure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, she is coming on finely.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rather disjointed talk, I am afraid, but that
is exactly the way it went on&#8211;the motor girls
and the boys discussing the story of Nancy Ford.</p>

<p>It was evening, and the boys had called to see
the girls in the bungalow of the latter. Nancy
had been visited by the doctor, who had reported
her much improved. The telling of her story
seemed to have taken an anxiety off her mind,
and with food and medicine she was rapidly regaining
her healthy young strength.</p>

<p>There had been rather a dramatic scene when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217'></a>217</span>
Jack and Ed were first allowed to see Nancy.
They both started back, and Jack exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the girl!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you are those nice boys&#8211;how odd,&#8221;
Nancy had said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please explain,&#8221; begged Cora.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;The night Ed and
I got lost. It was Nancy we met and gave a ride
in my auto.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suspected it all the while,&#8221; said Cora, with
a smile. &#8220;But I said nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a mere accident,&#8221; explained Nancy.
&#8220;I was just on one of the little trips I took after
I ran away from the office, and I miscalculated
my distance. It was awfully nice of your brother
to help me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Jack is always nice,&#8221; said Cora, smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;That means you buy the candy, old man,&#8221;
spoke Ed, with a laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; drawled Jack, as he stretched out
lazily on a sofa, later on, &#8220;now the only thing
left to do is to find that Mrs. Raymond, and
everything will be cleared up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That, and putting that mean Mr. Cross in&#8211;in
jail!&#8221; said Bess, with a vehement gesture.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you be so cruel?&#8221; asked Walter.</p>

<p>&#8220;What else can you do with him?&#8221; demanded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span>
Belle. &#8220;He has certainly been mean enough to
warrant being sent to prison.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;In a prison cell I sit!&#8217;&#8221; chanted Ed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; commanded Cora. &#8220;Nancy may be
sleeping, and the doctor said it was very important
for her to sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;d better clear out of here,&#8221; was
Norton&#8217;s opinion. &#8220;She&#8217;ll never get any rest
while this crowd holds forth. Come on, Eline,
I&#8217;ll take you to a moving picture show.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not after what has happened to-day,&#8221; declared
Mrs. Chester. &#8220;You young people have
had your own way all day, and now I want you
to quiet down. Boys, you will have to go home
soon. Girls, it&#8217;s almost time you were in bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aunt Susan is asserting herself,&#8221; remarked
Jack, <i>sotto voce</i>. &#8220;But don&#8217;t count on me, Aunt
Susan. I am immune.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll go with the rest,&#8221; she told him.</p>

<p>They sat about for some time longer, discussing
the strange tale related by Nancy. Then
came good-nights.</p>

<p>Cora went to see Mr. Haley, the light keeper,
next day. She told him what Nancy had related.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lobsters and crawfish!&#8221; he exclaimed, clapping
together his brown hands. &#8220;Begging your
pardon, of course, for using that sort of language,
miss, but my feelings sure did get the best of me.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span>
And so this Nancy Ford can clear my sister&#8217;s
name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She can and she will. I have wired for
mamma&#8217;s lawyer to come down, and he
will arrange matters. There is only one difficulty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that?&#8221; and the keeper of the light
looked worried. &#8220;You mean that there is a possibility
that my sister may even yet be guilty?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; but where are we to find her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so. Poor Margaret! Where can she
be keeping herself? If she would only come to
me&#8211;or write, I could let her know that it was
all right. And so those men were the robbers,
after all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems so, from what Nancy says.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Strange. I knew Margaret could not be
guilty, but how to prove it was the hard part.
When can we arrange it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As soon as we can find your sister.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear! And I haven&#8217;t the least idea
where to look for her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry,&#8221; suggested Cora, gently. &#8220;We
found our waif from the sea most unexpectedly,
and I am sure we will find your sister the same
way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not in a wreck, I hope,&#8221; said the light keeper,
with a smile. &#8220;We don&#8217;t want any more wrecks
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220'></a>220</span>
on this coast. Which reminds me that I must see
to the light.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was no fault of your light that
this wreck came,&#8221; said Cora. &#8220;Everybody says
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad of it. If I had thought that my
light failed, I&#8211;I&#8217;d never want to live longer,&#8221;
and his voice trembled.</p>

<p>&#8220;The steering gear got out of order,&#8221; said
Cora. &#8220;Nancy told me that. They could not
control the vessel in the storm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s always bad. Well, if we can find my
sister all will yet be well. I can&#8217;t thank you
enough for bringing me this good news.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad I had it to bring,&#8221; said Cora,
brightly.</p>

<p>Nancy Ford continued to gain in strength, and
the day came when she could go out. There was
a little celebration and the boys wanted to get
up an auto or a motor boat party, but Cora drew
the line.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some other time,&#8221; she said. Her mother&#8217;s
lawyer came to Sandy Point Cove, and looked
over some papers that Nancy had brought away
with her. His opinion was that the dishonest
guardian could be removed by the court, and he
promised to take charge of matters. Nancy was
much relieved.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221'></a>221</span>&#8220;But where can we find Mrs. Raymond?&#8221; she
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will take time,&#8221; said the lawyer. &#8220;I will
set some private detectives to work, and advertise,
advising her that she can be proven innocent if
she will come forward.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then came happy summer days. Nancy was
adopted by the motor girls, and stayed with them
in the bungalow. They went on long runs, or in
trips in the boats on the beautiful bay.</p>

<p>They were always welcome at the lighthouse,
and Mr. Haley liked nothing better than to sit
and talk with the boys and girls, telling them sea
stories, or listening to their little adventures.</p>

<p>But the search for Mrs. Raymond did not progress
very rapidly. Nothing was heard from her.
In the matter of removing Mr. Cross as Nancy&#8217;s
guardian, the procedure had to be slow, as there
were complications. But the lawyer was attending
to matters, and promised that soon all would
be straightened out.</p>

<p>By means of his representatives the lawyer, a
Mr. Beacon, heard indirectly from Mr. Cross,
but could not capture him. The latter was furious
at the escapade of his ward, and threatened
to have her brought back to him. In the matter
of the robbery he insisted that Mrs. Raymond
was guilty.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span>It was one glorious summer day when Cora
had taken the whole party out for a spin. In her
auto were Eline and Nancy, the others distributing
themselves in the various cars as suited their
fancy.</p>

<p>Several times, as they motored along the roads,
they were passed, or passed themselves, a low,
rakish motor car, of a dull dust color. Two men
were in it, and once or twice they favored the
occupants of Cora&#8217;s car with rather bold stares.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder who they can be?&#8221; asked Eline.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if they keep up this monkey business
much longer I&#8217;ll find out,&#8221; declared Jack.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go easy, please,&#8221; suggested his sister.</p>

<p>The only incident, or, rather, accident that
marred the trip, was when Cora&#8217;s car suffered a
puncture. It was on the run home.</p>

<p>&#8220;You go on,&#8221; she called to the others. &#8220;I
can fix it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;ll do it,&#8221; offered Jack. Perhaps the
presence of Nancy in the car induced him to linger,
together with Ed, who rode with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; assented Cora, not sorry to be relieved
of the task.</p>

<p>As Jack was struggling with the tire irons, the
rubber shoe being a most obstinate one, the low
racing car that had several times passed them,
again hove in sight. Cora was helping Jack, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223'></a>223</span>
Eline and Nancy had strolled down the road to
gather a few wild flowers.</p>

<p>The racing car stopped, one of the men leaped
out, and made a dash toward the two girls.
Eline, looking around, screamed, and Nancy,
hearing her, added to the exclamation.</p>

<p>&#8220;My guardian! My guardian!&#8221; she cried.
&#8220;I won&#8217;t go&#8211;I won&#8217;t go!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick, Jack!&#8221; cried Cora. &#8220;They&#8217;re trying
to take Nancy away. You must stop them!&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack, holding a heavy tire iron in his hand,
leaped forward toward the two girls. The man
had almost reached them, when there was heard
the loud honk of an auto horn coming around the
bend of the road.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224'></a>224</span><a id='link_28'></a>CHAPTER XXVIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>A STRANGE MESSAGE</span></h2>

<p>Nancy and Eline clung to each other. Nancy
had started to run off into the woods, but found
herself unequal to the task. A nervous tremor
seized her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Eline, Eline!&#8221; she begged. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let
him take me away! Don&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Nancy&#8217;s guardian was not destined to get
her into his control this time. No sooner had
the honk-honk of the other car been heard and
it had swung into sight around the bend of the
road, than the man in the other auto&#8211;the man
who had accompanied Mr. Cross&#8211;called out:</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out, Rickford, this may be a trap!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better believe it&#8217;s something to stop
you!&#8221; cried Jack, still swinging forward on the
run.</p>

<p>Cora, too, had started toward Eline and Nancy.
She saw that the big car probably had nothing
to do with the attempted abduction of the shipwrecked
girl, and that it was only coincidence
that brought it there at that moment. But it was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225'></a>225</span>
a fortunate coincidence, for it frightened away
the two men.</p>

<p>Like a flash Mr. Cross turned, sped back to
his car, and in another instant he and his crony
were speeding down the road.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s gone&#8211;he&#8217;s gone,&#8221; sobbed Nancy
on the shoulder of Eline.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course he&#8217;s gone!&#8221; cried Jack. &#8220;If he
hadn&#8217;t&#8211;&#8221; and he glanced significantly at the
tire iron in his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jack, dear,&#8221; said Cora, gently, with a warning
glance at Nancy. Cora did not want her
disturbed any more than was necessary.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&#8211;&#8221; blustered Jack, and let it go at that.</p>

<p>&#8220;Was that really your guardian, Nancy?&#8221;
asked Cora, when her new friend had somewhat
composed herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it was. Oh, has he gone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Far enough off by this time,&#8221; declared Jack.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know him at first, for he has grown
a beard,&#8221; said Nancy, &#8220;but when he came toward
me I could tell by the look in his eyes that it was
he. Oh, what an escape!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A very fortunate one,&#8221; said Cora.</p>

<p>The big car, the appearance of which had been
instrumental, perhaps, in preventing the taking
away of Nancy, drew near to the group of young
people and stopped. There were two middle-aged
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226'></a>226</span>
men in it, and they looked at our friends
curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Has anything happened&#8211;can we do anything?&#8221;
asked the one at the wheel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing but some tire trouble, thank you,&#8221;
said Cora, quickly. &#8220;And my brother can manage
that; can&#8217;t you, Jack?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, Sis,&#8221; and he winked at her to show that
he understood nothing was to be said about the
affair that had so nearly been a real &#8220;happening.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you want any help, don&#8217;t hesitate to ask
us,&#8221; put in the other man. &#8220;We are in no
hurry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, thank you, I can manage,&#8221; Jack answered.
&#8220;I had the repairs almost made when
the girls&#8211;thought they saw something, and
screamed.&#8221; He winked at Cora again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I see!&#8221; exclaimed the steersman with a
laugh. &#8220;A snake. We heard your screams,
and thought perhaps&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was just&#8211;nothing,&#8221; Cora said with a smile.
Eline and Nancy had turned and were walking
back toward their car, so the tear-stained face
of Nancy could not be observed.</p>

<p>With renewed offers of aid, which were courteously
declined, the two men proceeded, and
Cora and the others were free to discuss the recent
happening.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227'></a>227</span>&#8220;Do you really think he meant to take you
away&#8211;your guardian?&#8221; asked Cora of Nancy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I really do. Oh, he must be desperate! He
must be trying to get my property away from
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll soon have him attended to!&#8221; said Jack,
fiercely. &#8220;Our lawyer says the case will come
before the courts soon, and then good-bye to Mr.
Cross!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder how he knew where you were?&#8221;
asked Eline.</p>

<p>&#8220;You forget that the rescue of Nancy was told
of in the papers,&#8221; spoke Cora. &#8220;Doubtless he
read of it, and came on. He, or some of his
men, may have been spying around and knew just
when we went for a ride.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And they followed us, that&#8217;s one sure thing,&#8221;
added Jack. &#8220;Their car passed us several times.
They were just waiting for a good chance, and
they took the first opportunity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should have known him at once, when they
passed, but for his beard,&#8221; said Nancy. &#8220;Oh,
I feel so nervous and weak!&#8221; She was on the
verge of tears again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, we will go back to the bungalow,&#8221;
suggested Cora. &#8220;I must tell the lawyer about
it. He may wish to take some action.&#8221;</p>

<p>A little later they were back in the summer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228'></a>228</span>
cottage, where, to the wonderment of the others,
the strange story was told with all the details,
for when Cora&#8217;s car developed the tire trouble
the rest had continued on, Jack and Ed remaining
behind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m glad I was not along!&#8221; breathed
Belle.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I wish I had been!&#8221; exclaimed Walter.
&#8220;Jack, you and Ed had all the fun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t do anything,&#8221; said Ed. &#8220;Jack was
the hero.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only a near-hero,&#8221; said Cora&#8217;s brother. &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t get near enough to do any damage.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Beacon, the lawyer, on hearing the account
of what had happened, at once took steps to expedite
the matter of the removal of Mr. Cross as
guardian of Nancy Ford. He declared that the
attempted abduction would operate against the
unprincipled man. The matter of the loss of the
money, for which Mrs. Raymond was once suspected,
had been gone into, and the indications
pointed in many ways to Mr. Cross and his
crony.</p>

<p>&#8220;But it doesn&#8217;t seem as if Mrs. Raymond
would ever be found,&#8221; sighed Cora. &#8220;Poor
woman!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, my sister must be having a hard time,&#8221;
said the keeper of the light. &#8220;I wish she would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229'></a>229</span>
come to me. I could give her a good home now.
The work is almost too much for Rosalie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t mind, Daddy!&#8221; exclaimed the
little &#8220;mermaid.&#8221;</p>

<p>Summer was wearing on. It had been a most
glorious one and the bungalow residents had enjoyed
it thoroughly. They went off on several
motoring trips, but they were careful always to
remain in one party, and even then Nancy could
not forbear a nervous glance about whenever another
auto approached.</p>

<p>But Mr. Cross appeared to have taken himself
to parts unknown. Private detectives who were
looking for him, on an order of the court to
which Mr. Beacon had appealed, reported that
they could get no trace of him. Nor was the
whereabouts of the missing Mrs. Raymond discovered.</p>

<p>In their two motor boats the young people paid
visits to many near-by resorts, occasionally, when
the weather was fine, even venturing out on the
ocean. But, save for Cora, the girls were always
a little timid about this, and so the ocean trips
were not numerous.</p>

<p>One day Mr. Haley came hurrying over to
the girls&#8217; bungalow from the lighthouse. He
held a paper in his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is Miss Kimball?&#8221; he asked of Belle,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230'></a>230</span>
who answered his knock. &#8220;I must see her at
once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, has anything happened?&#8221; Belle asked
in sudden alarm. She looked down on the beach,
and was relieved to see Nancy safe there.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, miss, nothing has happened&#8211;yet,&#8221; replied
the keeper. &#8220;But I received a strange message
just now, and I want to tell Miss Kimball.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cora!&#8221; called Belle, and Cora, who had been
in an inner room, came out.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; she asked, and Mr. Haley
handed her the piece of paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;I just found that on my doorstep,&#8221; he explained.
&#8220;I was home all alone, my helper being
in town buying supplies, and Rosalie and Dick
being out in the boat. Read it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how did it get there?&#8221; asked Cora, as
she stepped over to a window to see more plainly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, except some boy must have
brought it there, left it and run away. It was
weighted with a stone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then that&#8217;s probably how it was left,&#8221; suggested
Belle. &#8220;But what is so mysterious about
it What does it say, Cora?&#8221;</p>

<p>Cora read:</p>

<p>&#8220;If you would have news of your sister come
alone to Shark&#8217;s Tooth at nine to-night.&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231'></a>231</span><a id='link_29'></a>CHAPTER XXIX<br /><span class='h2fs'>AT THE SHARK&#8217;S TOOTH</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;What a strange note!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it? And the odd way it was delivered!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the Shark&#8217;s Tooth, Mr. Haley?&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys and girls were all together in the
bungalow of the latter&#8211;or, rather, were out on
the broad porch, for, following the visit of the
light keeper, with the strange letter, they had
gathered to discuss the matter.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Shark&#8217;s Tooth,&#8221; said Mr. Haley, &#8220;is a
long, low ledge of rock, jutting out in the water
about a mile above the light. It looks somewhat
like a big tooth&#8211;the end of it does, I mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you go there?&#8221; asked Jack.</p>

<p>&#8220;I sure will, my boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s a trap,&#8221; suggested Ed. &#8220;This
fellow Cross may be trying to get hold of you,
Mr. Haley.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not afraid of him. I think I&#8217;ll be his
match,&#8221; and certainly the sturdy keeper looked
able to take care of himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;But he may not be alone,&#8221; suggested Walter.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232'></a>232</span>&#8220;However, we could go with you,&#8221; he added
hopefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;The note says to come alone, my lad, and
alone I&#8217;ll go. I&#8217;d do more than that to get news
of poor Margaret. I&#8217;m not afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You boys might be within call,&#8221; suggested
Cora. &#8220;You need not be seen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;d consent to that,&#8221; agreed Mr. Haley.
&#8220;And it might be a good thing. And yet, somehow,
I&#8217;m not worried.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is certainly a trap!&#8221; declared Norton.
&#8220;They want you to go there, a lonely spot&#8211;after
dark. Probably they&#8217;ll take you off in a boat!
Ha! I have it! Wreckers!&#8221; and he struck a
dramatic posture.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wreckers?&#8221; questioned Jack.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, don&#8217;t you see. They want to get Mr.
Haley in their control. Then they&#8217;ll carry him
off, some of them will put out the light and lure
vessels ashore by means of a false beacon. Then
they&#8217;ll get the booty!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, what sort of a dime novel have you been
reading lately?&#8221; asked Ed, with a laugh.
&#8220;Wreckers!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; maintained Norton, earnestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, lad,&#8221; said Mr. Haley, quietly, &#8220;it isn&#8217;t
wreckers, for the light would be well defended
by my helper, even if they got me. Besides it&#8217;s
dead low water at nine to-night, and they couldn&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233'></a>233</span>
get a boat within a mile of the Shark&#8217;s Tooth
without staving a hole in her. The only approach
is from the beach. I&#8217;m not afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Besides,&#8221; added Cora, &#8220;this note was written
by a woman. That&#8217;s plain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A trick!&#8221; declared Norton, who seemed to
insist on the melodramatic theory.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this like your sister&#8217;s writing?&#8221; asked
Belle.</p>

<p>&#8220;I really couldn&#8217;t be sure. Margaret was
never much of a writer, and I can hardly see to
read print, let alone writing, even with my glasses.
So I couldn&#8217;t say as to that. However, I&#8217;ll be
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And so will we,&#8221; added Jack, &#8220;out if sight,
of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is getting more and more complicated,&#8221;
declared Bess. &#8220;Oh, I do hope it won&#8217;t turn
out to be that horrid Mr. Cross, or any of his
men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; said Cora, in a low voice. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
make Nancy nervous. She is alarmed enough
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>It seemed as if night would never come, and
the boys and girls hardly had the heart for amusements
to make the time pass more quickly. They
remained near the bungalows, going in bathing
when the tide was right. Belle was learning to
swim with considerable confidence.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234'></a>234</span>&#8220;You are getting quite brave,&#8221; Cora told her
when she had gone out to the float and back all
alone.</p>

<p>Eline, who was rather daring in spite of her
timid manner, made a half-suggestion that the girls
go out in autos to see what happened at Shark&#8217;s
Tooth, but Mrs. Chester, exercising her authority,
vetoed the scheme.</p>

<p>Mr. Haley started off alone, and was followed
later by the boys, who arranged to conceal themselves
where they could have a view of the ledge
of rock that was uncovered at low water.</p>

<p>There was a half-moon that night and by the
light of it Jack and his chums could see the long,
black ledge extending out into the bay. They
had a glimpse of Mr. Haley walking slowly up
and down the beach, now and then looking at his
watch to note the time. Jack and the others did
likewise.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nine now,&#8221; whispered Walter, after a
long&#8211;a seemingly long&#8211;wait, though it was
really only a few minutes.</p>

<p>&#8220;And nothing seems to be happening,&#8221; remarked
Jack.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; suddenly exclaimed Ed, pointing to
the sandy stretch. A dark figure was seen gliding
over it&#8211;a figure of a woman&#8211;alone!</p>

<p>The light keeper heard the approaching footsteps,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235'></a>235</span>
and turned quickly. He stood for a moment
The woman had halted. Then Mr.
Haley cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Margaret!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jim!&#8221; she responded, and they clasped each
other close.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess it&#8217;s all right&#8211;they don&#8217;t need us,&#8221;
whispered Jack. &#8220;It&#8217;s his sister. She wrote
the note. It&#8217;s all right, we&#8217;ll go tell the girls the
mystery is solved and the missing one found.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;Say, this
is great, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It sure is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now that they are together&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, they may hear us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, I&#8217;m with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>But, as they started away, Mr. Haley called to
them:</p>

<p>&#8220;Boys, come here. I want&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, Jim dear! Don&#8217;t call anyone!&#8221; interrupted
Mrs. Raymond. &#8220;I dare not be seen.
You don&#8217;t know the stigma I am under. I even
hesitated to come and see you in this secret way,
but I am in need of help. It was the only way I
could think of. I am so&#8211;so afraid of arrest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you needn&#8217;t be!&#8221; cried her brother.
&#8220;We can prove your innocence!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Prove my innocence! How? Only Nancy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236'></a>236</span>
Ford can do that, and she can&#8217;t be found, I have
been searching for her so long&#8211;so long!&#8221; Her
sobs prevented her from talking.</p>

<p>&#8220;But Nancy Ford is found!&#8221; cried the keeper
of the light, &#8220;and the boys I called to&#8211;or rather
their girl friends&#8211;found her. It&#8217;s all right, Margaret.
Your name will be cleared, and you will
be happy with me. It&#8217;s all right, Sister!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, thank the dear Lord for that!&#8221; she
sobbed.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237'></a>237</span><a id='link_30'></a>CHAPTER XXX<br /><span class='h2fs'>HAPPY DAYS</span></h2>

<p>The sun was shining on a shimmering sea.
Little waves were breaking on the white sands.
The gulls were wheeling about in big circles.
Gathered in the old-fashioned living room of the
lighthouse were the motor girls, and two other
girls, Rosalie and Nancy Ford. Also the boys
were there, Mrs. Raymond, her brother, and Mr.
Beacon, the Kimballs&#8217; lawyer. He had just concluded
some remarks. It was the day after the
strange night scene at the Shark&#8217;s Tooth.</p>

<p>&#8220;And to think how it all came about,&#8221; spoke
Cora. &#8220;It is like a play, or a book.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It fits together like one of those Chinese puzzles,&#8221;
remarked Jack. &#8220;At first it seems as if
it never will, but one little touch, and&#8211;there you
are!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And it was Cora who supplied the one little
touch,&#8221; said Belle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I didn&#8217;t do it all,&#8221; remonstrated Cora.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, your finding Mrs. Raymond in the
burning garage started the whole affair,&#8221; insisted
Ed. &#8220;But for that we never would have known
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238'></a>238</span>
of Nancy Ford, nor how important she was in
this puzzle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be important,&#8221; answered
Nancy, with a smile. &#8220;I just want to go off
somewhere quietly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you may,&#8221; spoke Mr. Beacon, the lawyer,
with a smile. &#8220;The court proceedings will
not take long, now that your guardian is arrested.
The judge will require no further proof than his
commission of the crime to remove him from
having charge of you and your property, and
some one else will be named in his place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish the judge would name you!&#8221; exclaimed
Nancy impulsively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you!&#8221; laughed Mr. Beacon.</p>

<p>Mrs. Raymond had told her story. On up to
the time she had fled from the office, when the two
men came in, and her wanderings until she went
into the Kimball garage, my readers need no enlightenment.
After leaving Cora&#8217;s house so suddenly,
for fear she might be suspected of having
accidentally set the fire, the poor woman wandered
from place to place, vainly seeking Nancy
Ford. It was Mrs. Raymond whom the sheep
herder had met that night when he spoke kindly
to her. After that she kept moving about, getting
work in various offices, for she was an expert
in her line. But she could not find Nancy,
for reasons very well known to my readers.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239'></a>239</span>&#8220;And oh, how kind one of you girls was to
me!&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Raymond. &#8220;Your money
saved my life I believe,&#8221; and she held out the little
silver purse.</p>

<p>Finally, she explained, matters reached a point
where she could get no more work, and she had
to appeal to her brother. She had refrained
from doing that fearing she might be traced
through him, for she still feared she would be arrested
for the crime she had never committed.
But, growing desperate, she made the night appointment
with her brother, hiring a boy to leave
the note at the lighthouse, intending to explain
matters to Mr. Haley, get some money, and go
away again.</p>

<p>But it all ended happily.</p>

<p>&#8220;And so they caught Cross?&#8221; remarked Jack.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the lawyer, &#8220;one of the private
detectives got a clue and followed it up. They
got his crony, too, the other man who came in the
office when you ran out, Nancy. And they both
confessed, after pressure was brought to bear on
them. It is not the first crime Cross has been
guilty of. He has a bad record, I am told. I
learned of his arrest after I started here this
morning, following your telegram,&#8221; he said to
Cora, for, on learning of the arrival of Mrs.
Raymond, Cora had wired to her mother&#8217;s lawyer
to come in haste.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240'></a>240</span>&#8220;Then my name is cleared?&#8221; asked Mrs.
Raymond.</p>

<p>&#8220;Absolutely,&#8221; answered Mr. Beacon. &#8220;You
will not even have to appear in court.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish <i>I</i> didn&#8217;t have to,&#8221; said Nancy, nervously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can arrange to have a private hearing,&#8221;
went on the lawyer. &#8220;It will be no ordeal at
all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nor did Nancy find it so. A kindly judge in
his chambers, several days later, listened to the
story, and named Mr. Beacon as guardian of
Nancy Ford, whose property was, in the main,
saved from the clutches of Mr. Cross. He had
embezzled some of it, and that crime, with
others, brought him severe punishment.</p>

<p>As for Mrs. Raymond, she went to live with
her brother in the lighthouse.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now for some good times!&#8221; exclaimed
Cora when all the legal matters had been attended
to. &#8220;We have had enough of mystery and wonderings.
You can spend the rest of the summer
here with us; can&#8217;t you, Nancy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you want me, and have room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course we want you!&#8221; cried Jack. &#8220;Remember
you promised to ride in my car when we
go over to Stony Beach to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I asked her first!&#8221; cried Norton.</p>

<p>&#8220;But she promised me,&#8221; cut in Walter.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241'></a>241</span>&#8220;Oh, what boys!&#8221; protested the blushing
Nancy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mind them,&#8221; suggested Cora, putting
her arms around her new friend. &#8220;You&#8217;ll soon
get used to them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I can get used to almost <i>anything</i>&#8211;after
that shipwreck,&#8221; said Nancy, with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I like <i>that</i>!&#8221; cried Jack. &#8220;Comparing
us to a shipwreck! Come on, fellows, let&#8217;s
go fishing. The tide is right for crabbing, too,&#8221;
and they went out, leaving the girls to themselves.</p>

<p>&#8220;In spite of everything&#8211;the fire, the shipwreck
and the many wonderings it has been a
wonderful summer,&#8221; said Cora softly, as they sat
on the broad porch.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I wonder what the winter will bring
forth&#8211;and next summer?&#8221; remarked Belle. But
the further adventures of the little band of
friends must be reserved for another volume,
which will be entitled &#8220;The Motor Girls on Crystal
Bay; Or, The Secret of the Red Oar.&#8221;</p>

<p>The summer vacation was almost at an end.
There was one last motor boat trip, and then the
<i>Duck</i> was returned to its owner, and the <i>Pet</i> again
made ready for the land journey back to Chelton.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye, bungalows, good-bye!&#8221; recited
Cora on the day of their departure, as she got
into her big maroon car.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242'></a>242</span>&#8220;Good-bye, my lighthouse, good-bye!&#8221; sang
Bess.</p>

<p>&#8220;And don&#8217;t forget to write to us, little mermaid,&#8221;
called Jack to Rosalie. Blushingly she
promised.</p>

<p>&#8220;What will Nancy say?&#8221; asked Eline.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Nancy is coming to our house to stay&#8211;she
won&#8217;t have to write,&#8221; said the bold Jack.</p>

<p>There were more good-byes, to the light keeper
and his sister, to many fishermen and life-savers,
whose friendship the boys and girls had made,
and then the autos started off on the long trip
to Chelton.</p>

<p>Gaily fluttered in the wind the flags they bore,
the sea smiled under the yellow sun at the motor
girls, seeming to beckon them to return, but they
could not. And so, for a time, we will also say
good-bye.</p>
